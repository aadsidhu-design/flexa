üéØ ROM CUMULATIVE ARC FIX - Quick Summary
==========================================
Date: October 6, 2025
Status: ‚úÖ BUILD SUCCESSFUL

WHAT WAS FIXED:
--------------
1. ROM now measures CUMULATIVE ARC from start to peak (not peak-to-peak)
2. Removed ALL degree restrictions (no 15¬∞, 90¬∞, 180¬∞ caps)
3. Removed minimum rep size filters
4. Removed minimum circle radius restrictions

KEY ALGORITHM CHANGE:
--------------------
Before: Peak-to-peak segmentation
After:  Start ‚Üí Furthest Point cumulative arc

Formula: ROM = (arcLength / armRadius) √ó 180/œÄ

WHERE:
- arcLength = sum of all segment lengths from start to peak
- armRadius = calibrated arm length + 0.15m grip offset

FILES MODIFIED:
--------------
1. UnifiedRepROMService.swift
   - Line 182-201: Removed 15¬∞ minimum ROM threshold
   - Line 249-257: Removed 8cm minimum circle radius
   - Line 330-368: Removed all ROM clamping/validation limits
   - Line 690-703: Fixed circle radius gate logic

2. Universal3DROMEngine.swift
   - Line 230-283: Complete rewrite of calculateROMAndReset()
   - Line 1015-1090: Removed 90¬∞ and 180¬∞ caps
   - Line 1141-1173: Removed upper limit clamping
   - Line 449-563: Updated live ROM calculations

WHAT THIS MEANS:
---------------
‚úÖ Full arc measurement per rep (whole movement captured)
‚úÖ No artificial limits on ROM values
‚úÖ Small movements count as valid reps
‚úÖ Tiny circles count as valid reps
‚úÖ ROM can exceed 180¬∞ for vigorous movements

BUILD STATUS:
------------
‚úÖ Clean build successful
‚ö†Ô∏è  4 warnings (pre-existing, unrelated)
‚úÖ No errors

NEXT STEPS:
----------
1. Test on physical device
2. Verify ROM values match expected for known movements
3. Check that graphs display correctly without clamping
4. Validate rep counting works without filtering
