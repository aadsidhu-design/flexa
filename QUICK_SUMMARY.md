# ✅ Quick Fix Summary

## COMPLETED TODAY:

1. **FollowCircle Movement** - FIXED inverted circular motion (clockwise now works!)
2. **FollowCircle Rep Counting** - FIXED overcounting (350° + stricter validation)  
3. **Camera Coordinates** - FIXED vertical movement (hand UP = overlay UP)
4. **Scroll Indicators** - HIDDEN globally (14 files updated)
5. **Game Instructions** - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN (6 games, much clearer)

## FILES MODIFIED:

- `Games/FollowCircleGameView.swift` (2 critical fixes)
- `Utilities/CoordinateMapper.swift` (coordinate inversion fix)
- `Views/GameInstructionsView.swift` (all instructions rewritten)
- `Views/*.swift` (14 files - scroll indicators hidden)

## TEST THESE NOW:

1. FollowCircle - clockwise hand should make clockwise cursor
2. FollowCircle - 1 circle should = ~1 rep (not 14!)
3. BalloonPop - hand UP should move pin UP  
4. Constellation - hand UP should move circle UP
5. All games - read new instructions (much better!)
6. All views - no grey scroll bars

## STILL TODO (instructions provided in FINAL_FIX_SUMMARY.md):

- SPARC smoothness verification for camera games
- Remove extra circles/overlays
- Skip survey goal updates
- Download data feature
- Timer removal from Wall Climbers
- Fine-tune rep detection
