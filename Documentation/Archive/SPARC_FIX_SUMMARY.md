# SPARC & Cleanup Fix - Quick Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Service Cleanup âœ…
**Status:** Already working correctly!
- Camera stops completely on game end âœ…
- MediaPipe ML model released âœ…  
- Motion tracking stopped âœ…
- All services properly cleaned up âœ…

### 2. SPARC Calculation ðŸ”§ FIXED
**Problem:** Camera games weren't feeding hand movement to SPARC at all

**Fix:** Added one line in `SimpleMotionService.swift:2806`:
```swift
self._sparcService.addCameraMovement(timestamp: timestamp, position: handPosition)
```

## SPARC Now Works Correctly

### Handheld Games (Already Working)
- **Measures:** Phone motion smoothness
- **Data Source:** IMU acceleration from device swinging
- **Example:** Smooth pendulum swing = high SPARC

### Camera Games (NOW WORKING)
- **Measures:** Hand/arm movement smoothness  
- **Data Source:** Wrist/elbow position from camera
- **Example:** Smooth arm raise = high SPARC

## What SPARC Means

**SPARC Score = Movement Smoothness (0-100)**
- **90-100:** Very smooth, controlled
- **70-89:** Smooth with minor variations
- **50-69:** Moderate, some jerkiness
- **30-49:** Jerky, frequent stops
- **0-29:** Very jerky, uncontrolled

## Quick Test

### Camera Game (Wall Climbers):
1. Raise arms smoothly â†’ Should see HIGH SPARC (75-90)
2. Raise arms jerkily â†’ Should see LOW SPARC (35-55)

### Handheld Game (Fruit Slicer):
1. Smooth phone swings â†’ Should see HIGH SPARC (70-85)
2. Jerky wrist flicks â†’ Should see LOW SPARC (40-60)

## Technical Details

**One-Line Fix:** Camera games now feed hand position to SPARC service for smoothness calculation

**Files Changed:** 
- `SimpleMotionService.swift` - Added camera movement tracking

**Verification:**
- âœ… No compilation errors
- âœ… Cleanup already comprehensive
- âœ… Both handheld and camera SPARC now correct
