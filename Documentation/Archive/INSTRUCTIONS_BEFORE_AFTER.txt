📝 INSTRUCTIONS TRANSFORMATION - BEFORE & AFTER
==============================================

EXAMPLE: BALLOON POP
====================

BEFORE (Emoji-Heavy, Mixed Content):
------------------------------------
Step 1: 📱 PROP phone VERTICALLY so front camera sees your FULL UPPER BODY (arm fully visible)
Step 2: 💪 RAISE arm UP and fully EXTEND ELBOW - cyan pin at wrist tip pops balloons
Step 3: 🎈 Pin follows your wrist exactly - move hand UP to reach balloons at screen top
Step 4: ⭐ Full elbow extension = maximum ROM! Pop balloons one at a time by reaching high.

Problems:
❌ Emojis distract from content
❌ Setup and gameplay mixed together
❌ Inconsistent focus (phone, movement, gameplay all mixed)
❌ Caps lock feels like shouting


AFTER (Clean, Structured, Professional):
---------------------------------------
Step 1: Body Setup: Stand facing the camera. Position yourself so your arm is fully visible when raised.
Step 2: Phone Position: Prop phone vertically. Front camera should see from your waist to above your head.
Step 3: Movement: Raise arm up and fully extend your elbow. A cyan pin at your wrist tip pops balloons.
Step 4: Gameplay: Move hand up to reach balloons at screen top. Full elbow extension gives maximum ROM. Pop them one at a time.

Benefits:
✅ Clear category labels (Setup, Position, Movement, Gameplay)
✅ Professional therapeutic tone
✅ Logical progression from preparation to execution
✅ Easy to scan and understand
✅ Suitable for clinical/medical context


ANOTHER EXAMPLE: WALL CLIMBERS
===============================

BEFORE:
-------
Step 1: 📱 PROP phone VERTICALLY on table/stand/chair so camera sees YOUR FULL BODY
Step 2: 🙆 Raise BOTH arms HIGH above your head, then lower smoothly to sides - controlled motion
Step 3: 🏔️ Altitude increases as arms go up, decreases as they come down. Goal: reach 1000m!
Step 4: ⭐ NO TIME LIMIT - take your time. Smooth, full range arm raises climb faster!

AFTER:
------
Step 1: Body Setup: Stand facing the camera, arms at your sides. Ensure full body is visible on screen.
Step 2: Phone Position: Prop phone vertically on a stable surface (table, stand, or chair). Front camera should see your entire upper body.
Step 3: Movement: Raise both arms straight up above your head, then lower smoothly back to sides. Keep movements controlled.
Step 4: Gameplay: Altitude increases as arms rise. Reach 1000m to win. No time limit - focus on full range motion.


THE 4-STEP STRUCTURE
====================

Every game now follows this pattern:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│    Where to stand, posture, positioning │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                 ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. PHONE POSITION                       │
│    Camera: where to prop                │
│    Handheld: how to hold                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                 ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 3. MOVEMENT                             │
│    Physical exercise to perform         │
│    Technique and form                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                 ↓
