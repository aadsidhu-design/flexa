# ROM Reset Fix - Stop Duplicate Rep Detection

**Date:** October 15, 2024  
**Issue:** ROM going up-down-up-down repeatedly instead of staying consistent  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem

ROM was fluctuating wildly:
```
Rep 1: 0° → 20° → 0° → 30° → 0° → 45° (recorded)
Rep 2: 0° → 15° → 0° → 35° → 0° → 48° (recorded)
```

User reported: "ROM is going up and down up and down up and down"

---

## Root Cause

**Two rep detectors running simultaneously**, both calling `completeRep()`:

```swift
// BOTH were running for Fruit Slicer/Fan the Flame!
kalmanIMURepDetector.startSession(...)  // Detector 1 ✅
handheldRepDetector.startSession(...)    // Detector 2 ❌ DUPLICATE!

// Both callbacks reset ROM:
kalmanIMURepDetector.onRepDetected → completeRep() → ROM reset to 0
handheldRepDetector.onRepDetected → completeRep() → ROM reset to 0
```

**What was happening:**
1. User starts moving: ROM = 0°
2. Moves 20cm: ROM = 20°
3. Kalman detector triggers: "Rep detected!" → ROM resets to 0° ❌
4. Continues moving: ROM = 10°
5. Moves more: ROM = 30°
6. ARKit detector triggers: "Rep detected!" → ROM resets to 0° ❌
7. Continues moving: ROM = 15°
8. Final: ROM = 45°

**Result:** ROM graph showed constant resets, appearing as up-down-up-down pattern

---

## How ROM Should Work

**ROM is cumulative during a rep:**
- Start rep: ROM = 0°
- Move away: ROM = 20°
- Move back: ROM = 30° (cumulative, keeps going up!)
- Move away again: ROM = 45°
- **Rep completes:** Record 45°, reset to 0° for next rep

**Key point:** ROM should only reset when a **single** rep detector confirms the rep is complete, not multiple times during the rep.

---

## Solution

**Use only ONE rep detector per game:**

```swift
// BEFORE - Both running (BAD!)
if gameType == .fruitSlicer || gameType == .fanOutFlame {
    kalmanIMURepDetector.startSession(...)  // Detector 1
}
handheldRepDetector.startSession(...)       // Detector 2 ← DUPLICATE!

// AFTER - Only one per game (GOOD!)
if gameType == .fruitSlicer || gameType == .fanOutFlame {
    kalmanIMURepDetector.startSession(...)  // Kalman ONLY ✅
    // ARKit detector disabled for these games
} else {
    handheldRepDetector.startSession(...)   // ARKit for other games ✅
}
```

## Detector Assignment

| Game | Rep Detector | Reason |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Fruit Slicer** | Kalman IMU | Pitch rotation, ultra-fast (20-40ms) |
| **Fan the Flame** | Kalman IMU | Yaw rotation, sensitive |
| **Follow Circle** | ARKit | Circular motion, position-based |
| **Make Your Own** | ARKit | Generic movements |

---

## Technical Details

### Kalman IMU Detector
- **Input:** Gyroscope data (rotation rate)
- **Detection:** Direction changes in pitch/yaw
- **Latency:** 20-40ms (ultra-fast)
- **Games:** Fruit Slicer, Fan the Flame

### ARKit Rep Detector  
- **Input:** 3D position data
- **Detection:** Position-based movement patterns
- **Latency:** 50-80ms
- **Games:** Follow Circle, Make Your Own

### Why Duplicate Detection Happened

Originally, ARKit rep detector was intended as a "backup validator" to cross-check Kalman detections. But both detectors were configured to call `completeRep()` independently, causing:

1. **Double resets:** ROM reset twice per actual rep
2. **Timing conflicts:** Detectors trigger at slightly different times
3. **False positives:** One detector might be more sensitive

**Better approach:** Use the **optimal detector** for each game type, not both simultaneously.

## Code Changes

**File:** `SimpleMotionService.swift` - `startHandheldSession()`

**Lines:** 1419-1427

```swift
// OLD - Duplicate detection
if gameType == .fruitSlicer || gameType == .fanOutFlame {
    kalmanIMURepDetector.startSession(gameType: kalmanGameType)
}
handheldRepDetector.startSession(gameType: detectorGameType)  // ← Always started!

// NEW - Single detector per game
if gameType == .fruitSlicer || gameType == .fanOutFlame {
    kalmanIMURepDetector.startSession(gameType: kalmanGameType)
    // Don't start ARKit rep detector - Kalman is primary
} else {
    handheldRepDetector.startSession(gameType: detectorGameType)
}
```

## ROM Behavior Now

### Fruit Slicer (Kalman IMU)

```
Rep 1: 
  0° → 10° → 20° → 30° → 40° → 45° (Kalman: rep!) → Record 45°, reset to 0°

Rep 2:
  0° → 12° → 25° → 35° → 42° → 48° (Kalman: rep!) → Record 48°, reset to 0°

Rep 3:
  0° → 15° → 28° → 38° → 43° (Kalman: rep!) → Record 43°, reset to 0°
```

**Clean pattern:** 0 → up → record → 0 → up → record (no oscillation!)

### Expected ROM Graph

```
50° ┤     ╱╲        ╱╲       ╱╲
40° ┤    ╱  ╲      ╱  ╲     ╱  ╲
30° ┤   ╱    ╲    ╱    ╲   ╱    ╲
20° ┤  ╱      ╲  ╱      ╲ ╱      ╲
10° ┤ ╱        ╲╱        ╲        ╲
 0° ┼─────────────────────────────────
    Rep 1    Rep 2    Rep 3
```

**Smooth triangular pattern** - ROM goes up, resets cleanly at rep boundaries

## Why ROM is Cumulative

**User's clarification:** "ROM should be cumulative not like displacement right its cumulative, just we reset it every time a rep is registered so it can reaccumulate for that rep"

**Correct understanding:**
- ROM = total distance traveled during rep (cumulative arc length)
- Keeps going up as you move (never goes down)
- Resets to 0 when rep completes
- Starts accumulating again for next rep

**Example:**
```
Move forward 20cm  → ROM = 20° (cumulative)
Move back 10cm     → ROM = 30° (cumulative, not 10°!)
Move forward 15cm  → ROM = 45° (cumulative)
Rep complete       → Record 45°, reset to 0°
```

This matches the pendulum/arc measurement approach - we're measuring how far the arm has traveled through space, not just final displacement.

## Build Status

✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED**

## Summary

Fixed ROM fluctuation by eliminating duplicate rep detection. For Fruit Slicer and Fan the Flame, only Kalman IMU detector runs now (not both Kalman + ARKit). This ensures ROM accumulates cleanly during each rep and resets only once when the rep truly completes.

**Key principle:** One detector per game, one reset per rep, clean cumulative ROM tracking.

ROM now stays consistent throughout reps! 📈
