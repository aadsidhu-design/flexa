**Games → Arm Raises / Constellation Maker**

### Test 1: Triangle Validation
**Expected Behavior:** Can start anywhere, connect any unvisited point, must close to start

1. Start the Arm Raises game
2. Move your wrist to ANY dot to begin (don't have to start at top)
3. Connect dots in any order (e.g., start at bottom-left → top → bottom-right)
4. Try to complete WITHOUT returning to start
   - ❌ Should NOT show "Complete"
5. Return to your starting dot
   - ✅ Should show "Complete" and move to next pattern
6. **PASS:** Pattern completes only when closed

### Test 2: Square Diagonal Prevention
**Expected Behavior:** Must follow edges, diagonals are blocked

1. Continue to Square pattern (2nd pattern)
2. Start at any corner
3. Try to connect to diagonal corner (e.g., top-left → bottom-right)
   - ❌ Should show "Incorrect" in RED
   - ❌ Should play error haptic
   - ❌ Should RESET pattern after 0.5s
4. Start again and follow edges properly (e.g., 0→1→2→3→0)
   - ✅ Should complete successfully
5. **PASS:** Diagonals rejected, edges accepted

### Test 3: Circle Adjacent-Only Rule
**Expected Behavior:** Can only connect to immediate left/right neighbor

1. Continue to Circle pattern (3rd pattern)
2. Start at any dot on the circle
3. Try to skip a dot (e.g., if at position 0, try to go to position 2)
   - ❌ Should show "Incorrect" in RED
   - ❌ Should reset pattern
4. Start again and go to immediate neighbor (position 0 → 1 or 0 → 7)
   - ✅ Should accept connection
5. Continue around the circle one dot at a time
   - ✅ Should complete when all connected
6. **PASS:** Only adjacent connections work

### Test 4: Visual Feedback
**Expected Behavior:** Dots stay in place, change color, lines persist

2. As you connect dots, verify:
   - ✅ Dots NEVER move from original position
   - ✅ Connected dots turn GREEN
   - ✅ Cyan lines stay between connected dots
   - ✅ Live line follows your wrist to next target
3. **PASS:** Visual feedback is clear and stable

### Test 5: Dynamic Instructions
**Expected Behavior:** Instructions change per pattern

1. Triangle: Should say "Connect all points, then return to start!"
2. Square: Should say "Follow the edges - no diagonals!"
3. Circle: Should say "Go left or right to next point!"
4. **PASS:** Instructions are context-aware

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES (Pre-Existing)

These issues existed before recent fixes and are not regressions:

1. `MovementPatternAnalyzer.swift` - Type resolution errors (doesn't affect runtime)
2. `ComprehensiveSessionData.swift` - Minor type warnings (non-critical)

These do not affect app functionality in Debug/Release builds.

## 📝 REGRESSION TESTING

After any future changes, re-run all tests in this guide to ensure:
- Constellation validation still works
- Pain graph still shows zero values
- Altitude meter remains text-free
- Custom exercises continue functioning
