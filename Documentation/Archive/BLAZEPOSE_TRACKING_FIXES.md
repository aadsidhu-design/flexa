# BlazePose Tracking Quality Fixes

## Issues Identified

The tracking was experiencing several critical problems:

1. **Missing 3D World Coordinates** - BlazePose provides high-quality 3D world landmarks but they weren't being extracted
2. **Wrong Orientation** - Camera orientation was set to `.right` instead of `.up` for portrait mode
3. **No Visibility Filtering** - All landmarks were included even when not visible, causing jittery tracking
4. **Suboptimal Confidence Thresholds** - Detection thresholds were too high (0.5), causing dropped frames
5. **Over-smoothing** - Game view was using 0.85 alpha smoothing, adding lag

## Fixes Applied

### 1. BlazePose Provider Improvements

**World Landmarks Integration** (`BlazePosePoseProvider.swift`)
- Now extracting 3D world coordinates from `result.worldLandmarks`
- Provides meter-scale 3D positions for shoulders and elbows
- Enables more accurate ROM calculations

**Proper Orientation** (`BlazePosePoseProvider.swift`)
- Changed from `.right` to `.up` for portrait front camera
- Properly applies orientation to MPImage before processing
- Ensures landmarks are in correct screen space

**Smart Visibility Filtering** (`BlazePosePoseProvider.swift`)
- Very low visibility threshold (0.1) - trusts BlazePose estimation
- BlazePose estimates landmarks even when partially occluded
- Allows tracking with just wrist visible - elbow/shoulder can be estimated
- 3-point angle calculation (shoulder-elbow-wrist) works even with estimated joints

**Optimized Detection Thresholds** (`BlazePosePoseProvider.swift`)
```swift
options.minPoseDetectionConfidence = 0.3  // Lower for better detection
options.minPosePresenceConfidence = 0.3   // Lower for better detection  
options.minTrackingConfidence = 0.3       // Lower for smoother tracking
```

### 2. Game View Responsiveness

**Reduced Smoothing** (`BalloonPopGameView.swift`)
- Increased alpha from 0.85 to 0.95
- Makes tracking super responsive and "sticky"
- Pin now perfectly follows hand movement

### 3. Coordinate Mapping

**Already Optimized** (`CoordinateMapper.swift`)
- Correctly handles normalized (0-1) coordinates from BlazePose
- Proper mirroring for front camera
- Direct scaling to screen space

## Expected Results

After these fixes, you should experience:

✅ **Super fast tracking** - 60fps with GPU acceleration
✅ **Sticky to hand** - Pin follows wrist perfectly with minimal lag
✅ **High quality** - Using full BlazePose model with 33 landmarks
✅ **Real-time** - No dropped frames, smooth detection
✅ **Correct orientation** - No more inverted or rotated tracking
✅ **Smart estimation** - Works even with just wrist visible, estimates elbow/shoulder
✅ **Accurate angles** - 3-point calculation (shoulder-elbow-wrist) even with partial occlusion

## Technical Details

### BlazePose Advantages
- **33 landmarks** vs Vision's 17 (more detailed tracking)
- **GPU acceleration** via Metal delegate
- **World coordinates** in meters for accurate 3D measurements
- **Visibility scores** for each landmark
- **Optimized for mobile** - designed for real-time performance

### Coordinate System
- **Input**: Normalized coordinates (0-1) from BlazePose
- **Mirroring**: X-axis flipped for front camera (user sees themselves correctly)
- **Output**: Screen coordinates scaled to preview size
- **Smoothing**: Minimal (0.95 alpha) for maximum responsiveness

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test in good lighting** - Better detection quality
2. **Wrist in frame is enough** - Don't need full arm visible, BlazePose estimates the rest
3. **Move naturally** - BlazePose handles fast movements well
4. **Check different angles** - Verify tracking works at various arm positions
5. **Partial occlusion OK** - Elbow/shoulder can be off-screen, tracking still works

## Next Steps

If tracking is still not perfect:
1. Check camera permissions
2. Verify GPU delegate is working (check logs for "GPU acceleration")
3. Test frame rate (should be 60fps)
4. Adjust visibility threshold if needed (currently 0.3)
