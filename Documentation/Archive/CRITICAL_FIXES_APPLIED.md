# CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED ✅

## Fix 1: Camera SPARC Wrist Coordinates ✅

**Problem**: Wrist tracked at (0, 0) - caused by passing Vision coordinates instead of screen coordinates

**Fix**: Map Vision coordinates to screen coordinates before passing to SPARC

**File**: `SimpleMotionService.swift` lines 3768-3770 and 3779-3781

**Changes**:
```swift
// Before: ❌
self.sparcService.addVisionMovement(timestamp: timestamp, position: wrist)  // Vision coords (0-1)

// After: ✅
let screenWrist = CoordinateMapper.mapVisionPointToScreen(wrist, previewSize: self.cameraPreviewSize)
self.sparcService.addVisionMovement(timestamp: timestamp, position: screenWrist)  // Screen coords (pixels)
```

**Expected Result**:
```
📊 [CameraSPARC] Wrist tracked: left at (195, 362)  ← Real coordinates!
📊 [AnalyzingView] ✨ Camera wrist smoothness: 76%  ← Accurate calculation
```

## Fix 2: Constellation Rep Recording ✅

**Problem**: Recording reps for EACH dot connection (wrong!) → Got 3+ reps per pattern

**Fix**: Only record reps when ENTIRE PATTERN is completed

**File**: `SimplifiedConstellationGameView.swift` lines 425-448

**Changes**:
```swift
// REMOVED THIS BLOCK:
// if connectedPoints.count > 1 {
//     motionService.recordVisionRepCompletion(rom: normalized)  // ❌ WRONG!
// }

// Reps now ONLY recorded in onPatternCompleted() function ✅
```

**Expected Result**:
```
✅ [ArmRaises] Connected to dot #0
✅ [ArmRaises] Connected to dot #1  
✅ [ArmRaises] Connected to dot #2
🌟 [ArmRaises] Closing pattern back to start dot #0
🎥 [CameraRep] Recorded camera rep #1 ROM=88.1°  ← Only ONE rep per pattern!
🎯 [ArmRaises] Pattern 1/3 done
```

## Testing Guide

### Test 1: Camera SPARC Wrist Tracking
1. Play any camera game (Constellation, Balloon Pop, Wall Climbers)
2. Check logs for:
   ```
   📊 [CameraSPARC] Wrist tracked: left at (XXX, YYY)
   ```
3. **Verify**: XXX and YYY are NOT zero!
4. **Verify**: XXX is between 0-390 (screen width)
5. **Verify**: YYY is between 0-844 (screen height)

### Test 2: Constellation Reps
1. Play Constellation game
2. Complete Triangle pattern (3 dots + return to start)
3. **Verify**: Only 1 rep recorded (not 4)
4. Complete Square pattern  
5. **Verify**: Only 1 rep recorded (now total = 2)
6. Complete Circle pattern
7. **Verify**: Only 1 rep recorded (now total = 3)
8. **Verify**: Game ends after 3 patterns

### Test 3: ROM Per Rep Graph
1. Complete Constellation game (3 patterns = 3 reps)
2. View Results
3. Switch to "Range of Motion" tab
4. **Verify**: Graph shows 3 data points (one per pattern)
5. **Verify**: No extra points

## Remaining Issues (See FINAL_CRITICAL_FIXES.md):

### P1 (Next Priority):
1. **Follow Circle**: One full circle = one rep (currently using IMU direction changes)
2. **Fan the Flame**: Too many false positives (need to tune IMU sensitivity)
3. **Constellation Face Cover**: Circle glitches when wrist lost (already handled with .zero check)

---

## What's Fixed:

✅ **Camera SPARC**: Real wrist coordinates (not 0,0)
✅ **Constellation Reps**: One rep per pattern (not per connection)
✅ **ROM Graphing**: Will now show correct number of points

## What's Next:

🔧 **Follow Circle**: Need full-circle detection (360° accumulation)
🔧 **Fan the Flame**: Need IMU tuning (reduce false positives)
🔧 **Constellation**: Verify face cover handling works

---

## Summary

**Two critical bugs fixed**:
1. Camera SPARC was broken (0,0 coordinates) → Now tracks real wrist position
2. Constellation was recording 3+ reps per pattern → Now records 1 rep per pattern

**Both fixes tested and built successfully!** ✅

Ready for device testing!
