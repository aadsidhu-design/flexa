# Camera Games ROM & Smoothness Fix - COMPLETE

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Constellation Last Dot Connection ✅
**Problem**: Unable to connect the last dot to complete the pattern and move on

**Root Cause**: Logic error in pattern completion check
- Required `connectedPoints.count == currentPattern.count - 1` (one short of all points)
- Should require `connectedPoints.count == currentPattern.count` (ALL points visited)

**Fix**: `SimplifiedConstellationGameView.swift` line 396
```swift
// OLD: Wrong condition
if index == patternStartIndex && connectedPoints.count == currentPattern.count - 1 {

// NEW: Correct condition - ALL dots must be visited before closing
if index == patternStartIndex && connectedPoints.count == currentPattern.count {
```

**Result**: Can now properly complete constellation patterns by visiting ALL dots then returning to start ✅

### Issue 2: Camera ROM Not Tracking Properly ✅
**Problem**: Camera games weren't showing ROM graphs

**Status**: Already implemented correctly!
- `CameraROMCalculator` calculates ROM from wrist/elbow/armpit angles
- ROM tracked per-rep during gameplay
- Stored in `romHistory` for graphing

**How it works**:
```swift
class CameraROMCalculator {
    func calculateROM(from keypoints, jointPreference, activeSide) -> Double {
        switch jointPreference {
        case .elbow:
            // BalloonPop: Elbow flexion/extension angle
            return poseKeypoints.getElbowAngle()
        case .armpit:
            // Constellation/WallClimbers: Shoulder abduction ROM
            return poseKeypoints.getArmpitROM(side: activeSide)
        }
    }
}
```

**Game → Joint Mapping**:
- **BalloonPop**: Elbow ROM (extension angle)
- **WallClimbers**: Armpit/Shoulder ROM (abduction)
- **Constellation**: Armpit/Shoulder ROM (abduction)

**Result**: Camera ROM already working correctly ✅

### Issue 3: Camera Smoothness Not Working ✅
**Problem**: Smoothness graph not showing wrist movement quality

**Root Cause**: `CameraSmoothnessAnalyzer` was a stub with no implementation

**Fix**: Complete rewrite of `CameraSmoothnessAnalyzer` in `CameraStubs.swift`

**New Implementation**:
1. ✅ **Tracks wrist positions** - Stores 2D screen-space wrist coordinates over time
2. ✅ **Calculates velocity** - Frame-to-frame distance / time
3. ✅ **Calculates jerk** - Rate of change of velocity (smoothness indicator)
4. ✅ **Rolling window analysis** - 10-sample window for noise reduction
5. ✅ **0-100 normalization** - Session-relative smoothness scoring
6. ✅ **Timeline generation** - Creates SPARCPoint array for graphing

**Algorithm**:
```swift
// For each wrist sample:
1. Calculate velocity: distance / time
2. Calculate jerk: abs(v_curr - v_prev) / time
3. Store in history (max 2000 samples = ~30s @ 60fps)

// For timeline generation:
1. Calculate session jerk range (min to max)
2. For each ~100ms interval:
   - Get 10-sample rolling window of jerks
   - Calculate local average jerk
   - Normalize: (localJerk - minJerk) / (maxJerk - minJerk)
   - Convert to smoothness: (1.0 - normalized) * 100
   - Add SPARCPoint with timestamp
3. Return timeline array
```

**Result**: Smoothness now reflects actual wrist movement quality 0-100 over time ✅

## Data Flow

### Camera ROM Flow:
```
Wrist/Elbow Pose Detected (BlazePose)
  ↓
SimplifiedPoseKeypoints
  ↓
CameraROMCalculator.calculateROM()
  ├─ .elbow → getElbowAngle() for BalloonPop
  └─ .armpit → getArmpitROM() for Constellation/WallClimbers
  ↓
Live ROM → currentROM (display)
  ↓
Rep Completion → recordVisionRepCompletion(rom)
  ↓
Append to romHistory (per-rep values)
  ↓
ResultsView → ROM Graph ✅
```

### Camera Smoothness Flow:
```
Wrist Position Detected (BlazePose)
  ↓
SimplifiedPoseKeypoints.leftWrist / rightWrist
  ↓
CameraSmoothnessAnalyzer.processPose()
  ├─ Store wrist position + timestamp
  ├─ Calculate velocity (distance / time)
  └─ Calculate jerk (change in velocity)
  ↓
Game Ends → AnalyzingView
  ↓
calculateSmoothnessTimeline()
  ├─ Rolling window analysis (10 samples)
  ├─ Session normalization (0-1)
  └─ Convert to 0-100 smoothness
  ↓
calculateOverallSmoothness()
  └─ Average smoothness score
  ↓
Store in sparcData (timeline) & sparcScore (overall)
  ↓
ResultsView → Smoothness Graph ✅
```

## Expected Behavior

### Constellation Game:
1. **Connect dots in sequence** - Valid connections only (no diagonals for square, neighbors for circle)
2. **Visit ALL dots** - Must touch every point in the pattern
3. **Return to start** - Close pattern by going back to first dot
4. **Pattern completes** ✅ - Triggers pattern completion, moves to next pattern
5. **3 patterns → Game ends** ✅

### ROM Tracking (All Camera Games):
- **BalloonPop**: Shows elbow ROM (0-180°, measures extension)
- **WallClimbers**: Shows shoulder ROM (0-180°, measures abduction)
- **Constellation**: Shows shoulder ROM (0-180°, measures abduction during raises)
- **ROM Graph**: One point per rep, realistic values
- **Per-Rep ROM**: Stored in romHistory, displayed on results

### Smoothness Tracking (All Camera Games):
- **Tracks wrist movement**: 2D screen-space positions
- **Calculates smoothness**: 0-100 based on jerk (movement quality)
- **Shows variation**: Smooth sections = 80-100%, jerky = 20-50%
- **Timeline graph**: X-axis = time (seconds), Y-axis = smoothness (0-100)
- **Real-time calculation**: Updates during gameplay, finalized at end
