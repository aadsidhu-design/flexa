---

## üß† Feature 1: Adaptive Learning Algorithm

### What It Does
The system now learns the user's actual movement capability during the first 3-5 reps and dynamically adjusts thresholds to match their performance level, rather than relying solely on AI estimates.

### Implementation Details

**Multi-Phase Learning:**
```swift
Phase 1 (Reps 1-3): Learning Mode
- Uses 40th percentile of observed amplitudes
- 20% more lenient than base threshold
- Encourages proper form establishment

Phase 2 (Reps 4+): Performance Mode  
- Uses 70th percentile with trend adjustment
- Adapts based on improving/declining patterns
- Scales with user's momentum
```

**Trend-Aware Adaptation:**
- Tracks recent 3 reps to detect improvement or fatigue
- Increases threshold if user is consistently improving
- Maintains threshold if performance is steady
- Prevents too-easy reps from false positives

**Key Code Location:**
- `CustomRepDetector.swift` - Lines ~70-140
- `AdaptiveThresholds` struct with trend analysis
- Used in all rep detection methods (pendulum, circular, vertical, etc.)

### Benefits
- **Users benefit:** Exercises automatically match their current capability
- **No frustration:** Won't reject valid reps because AI guessed wrong threshold
- **Progressive challenge:** Naturally gets harder as user improves within session
- **Fatigue handling:** Recognizes when user is tiring and adjusts accordingly

## üèÜ Feature 2: Movement Quality Scoring

### What It Does
Evaluates every single rep on multiple quality dimensions and provides a 0-100 score that reflects movement excellence.

### Scoring Components

**1. Amplitude Score (40% weight)**
```
Scoring curve:
- Below threshold: 0 points (invalid rep)
- At threshold (1.0x): 50 points (minimal)
- Ideal range (1.5x-2.5x threshold): 100 points (excellent)
- Above 2.5x: 70-90 points (diminishing returns, may be rushing)
```

**2. Consistency Score (35% weight)**
```
Based on coefficient of variation across recent reps:
- CV < 0.15 (highly consistent): 100 points
- CV = 0.33 (moderate variance): 50 points  
- CV > 0.5 (erratic): 0 points
```

**3. Timing Score (25% weight)**
```
Rep duration analysis:
- Too fast (< 0.4s): 30 points (rushing)
- Ideal (0.8-2.0s): 100 points (controlled)
- Too slow (> 4s): 50 points (may indicate difficulty)
```

### Quality Score Interpretation
- **85-100:** Excellent form - Olympic athlete level
- **70-84:** Good form - solid therapeutic movement
- **55-69:** Acceptable - meeting minimum standards
- **40-54:** Poor form - needs improvement
- **0-39:** Very poor - may need guidance or easier exercise

### Key Code Location
- `CustomRepDetector.swift` - Lines ~236-350
- `MovementQualityScorer` struct
- Published as `@Published movementQualityScore: Double`

### Benefits
- **Objective feedback:** Users see exactly how well they're performing
- **Motivation:** High scores encourage continued good form
- **Self-correction:** Low scores prompt users to focus on quality
- **Trend tracking:** Can track quality improvement over sessions

---

## üìà Feature 3: Progressive Difficulty Scaling

### What It Does
Analyzes user performance across multiple sessions and intelligently suggests when to increase difficulty.

### Progression Criteria

**Aggressive Progression (15% increase):**
- Completed at least 3 sessions
- Consistently exceeding threshold by 40%+ (avg ROM 1.4x+ threshold)
- High consistency score (> 0.7)
- Example: "You're exceeding the target by 45%! Ready to challenge yourself more."

**Moderate Progression (12% increase):**
- Completed at least 5 sessions
- Exceeding threshold by 25%+ (avg ROM 1.25x+ threshold)
- Good consistency score (> 0.65)
- Example: "After 5 sessions, you're ready to increase difficulty for continued progress."

### Implementation Details

**Progression Suggestion Structure:**
```swift
struct ProgressionSuggestion {
    exerciseId: UUID
    exerciseName: String
    currentThreshold: Double (e.g., 45¬∞)
    suggestedThreshold: Double (e.g., 52¬∞)
    reason: String (personalized explanation)
    confidence: Double (0-1, how sure we are)
    increasePercentage: Int (calculated, e.g., 15%)
}
```

**Smart Reset After Progression:**
When user applies progression:
- New threshold becomes the baseline
- Average ROM/SPARC reset to nil (fresh start)
- Completion count reset to 0
- System treats it as a "new" exercise variant

### Key Code Locations
- `CustomExerciseManager.swift` - Lines ~78-120
- `shouldSuggestProgressionFor()` - Detection logic
- `applyProgression()` - Application logic
- `Models/CustomExercise.swift` - ProgressionSuggestion struct

### Benefits
- **Continued growth:** Prevents plateaus by increasing challenge
- **Personalized pacing:** Each user progresses at their own rate
- **Clear milestones:** Provides sense of achievement
- **Prevents boredom:** Keeps exercises engaging over time

## ü§ñ Feature 4: Enhanced AI Prompt Engineering

### What Changed
Completely rewrote the Gemini AI prompt from ~40 lines to **130+ lines** with sophisticated context-aware reasoning.

### New Prompt Features

**1. Intelligent Context Detection**
- Recognizes device-centric language ("hold phone", "tilt", "shake") ‚Üí Handheld mode
- Recognizes body-centric language ("raise arms", "overhead reach") ‚Üí Camera mode
- Handles ambiguous cases with smart defaults

**2. Biomechanics-Based Joint Selection**
```
Armpit joint for:
- Shoulder elevation, abduction, overhead movements
- Examples: "raise arm", "T-pose", "reach overhead"

Elbow joint for:
- Elbow flexion/extension, forearm movements  
- Examples: "bicep curl", "bend elbow", "hammer curl"
```

**3. Context-Aware Threshold Selection**
```
Post-surgery/acute pain keywords ‚Üí 20-30¬∞ (gentle)
Early rehabilitation ‚Üí 35-45¬∞ (building)
Active rehabilitation ‚Üí 50-65¬∞ (standard)
Performance/sports rehab ‚Üí 70-90¬∞ (challenging)

Adjusts based on user language:
- "gentle", "careful" ‚Üí Lower threshold
- "full range", "maximum" ‚Üí Higher threshold
```

**4. Comprehensive Movement Classification**
- 6 movement types with detailed pattern recognition
- Keywords, synonyms, and intent detection
- Multi-planar movement support

**5. Enhanced Directionality Logic**
- Explains why bidirectional vs unidirectional vs cyclical
- Considers therapeutic value of each choice
- Context-specific rep counting logic

**6. Detailed Reasoning Requirement**
```
AI must explain:
- Why tracking mode was chosen (specific keywords)
- Why joint selection makes biomechanical sense
- Why movement type classification fits the pattern
- Why threshold values are therapeutically appropriate
- Any assumptions made and alternatives considered
```

**7. Edge Case Handling**
- Vague descriptions ‚Üí Favor simpler interpretation
- Multiple interpretations ‚Üí Choose most therapeutic
- Unusual exercises ‚Üí Use "mixed" with explanation
- Contradictory info ‚Üí Prioritize biomechanically correct

### Example AI Response Quality Improvement

**Old Prompt Result:**
```json
{
  "exerciseName": "Arm Swing",
  "reasoning": "Handheld exercise with pendulum motion"
}
```

**New Prompt Result:**
```json
{
  "exerciseName": "Pendulum Arm Swing",
  "reasoning": "Selected handheld mode because user mentioned 'hold phone' and 'swing', indicating direct device manipulation. Chose pendulum movement type due to 'forward and back' keywords describing sagittal plane oscillation. Set 45¬∞ ROM threshold for moderate rehabilitation intensity (no pain indicators mentioned). Bidirectional counting chosen as full swing cycle (forward + back) provides complete therapeutic benefit. 1.5s rep cooldown allows controlled movement without rushing. Confidence high (0.85) due to clear directional cues and device interaction language."
}
```

### Key Code Location
- `AIExerciseAnalyzer.swift` - Lines ~102-160 (buildAnalysisPrompt method)

### Benefits
- **Higher accuracy:** Better understands user intent
- **Better reasoning:** Explains why parameters were chosen
- **Fewer errors:** Handles ambiguous cases intelligently
- **Therapeutic focus:** Prioritizes rehabilitation best practices

## ‚ö° Feature 5: Smart Threshold Adjustment (Real-Time)

### What It Does
During exercise execution, continuously refines the detection threshold based on observed movement patterns.

### How It Works

**Amplitude Recording:**
Every successful rep's amplitude is recorded in a history buffer (max 15 samples).

**Threshold Calculation:**
```swift
Learning Phase (Reps 1-3):
- Use 40th percentile of observed amplitudes
- Apply 0.85 multiplier (extra lenient)
- Ensure at least 80% of base threshold

Performance Phase (Reps 4+):
- Use 70th percentile (challenging but achievable)
- Apply trend adjustment (-0.1 to +0.1 multiplier)
- Ensure threshold never drops below base
```

**Trend Analysis:**
- Positive trend (improving): Slightly increase threshold
- Negative trend (fatiguing): Slightly decrease threshold
- Stable trend: Maintain percentile-based threshold

### Fallback Safety Mechanism
If user attempts many reps but none are counted (stuck):
- Triggers after 3 consecutive failed attempts
- Temporarily eases threshold by 10%
- Logs diagnostic info
- Prevents frustration from impossible detection

### Key Code Location
- `CustomRepDetector.swift` - Lines ~70-140
- Used in `detectPeakValleyRep()`, `detectCircularRep()`, etc.

### Benefits
- **No calibration needed:** System auto-calibrates to user
- **Adapts to fatigue:** Recognizes declining performance
- **Encourages improvement:** Subtly increases challenge
- **Prevents stuck states:** Fallback prevents impossible exercises

## üéÆ User Experience Flow

### During Exercise Session

**Rep 1-3 (Learning Phase):**
1. System observes user's natural movement amplitude
2. Adaptive threshold sets itself to 40th percentile
3. Quality scorer begins collecting data
4. User sees quality scores appearing (typically 50-70 as they warm up)

**Rep 4+ (Performance Phase):**
5. Threshold adjusts to 70th percentile (more challenging)
6. Quality scores stabilize (typically 70-90 for consistent form)
7. Trend analysis tracks if user is improving or tiring
8. Rep counter increments smoothly with good form

**End of Session:**
9. Final quality score reflects session performance
10. ROM and SPARC data saved
11. System checks if user qualifies for progression

### Between Sessions

**After 3-5 Sessions:**
- User opens custom exercises
- System detects: "Wow, you're exceeding threshold by 40%!"
- Progression suggestion appears
- User can choose to apply (15% harder) or decline

**After Applying Progression:**
- Exercise resets to new baseline
- User experiences appropriately challenging difficulty
- System begins learning again at new level
