# AI-Powered Custom Exercise System - Complete Implementation

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Build Successful  
**Impact:** Major Feature - AI-Driven Custom Exercise Creation

---

## Executive Summary

Implemented a comprehensive AI-powered system that allows users to create fully custom shoulder rehabilitation exercises by describing them in natural language. The system uses Gemini AI to parse descriptions and automatically configure motion tracking, rep detection, and ROM measurement.

---

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Models** (`CustomExercise.swift`)
   - `CustomExercise`: Represents user-created exercises with tracking mode, rep parameters, statistics
   - `AIExerciseAnalysis`: Structured output from Gemini AI parser
   - Supports both handheld (ARKit) and camera (Vision) tracking modes

2. **AI Parser** (`AIExerciseAnalyzer.swift`)
   - Gemini 2.0 Flash integration with structured JSON responses
   - Analyzes exercise descriptions to determine:
     - Tracking mode (handheld vs camera)
     - Joint to track (armpit vs elbow for camera mode)
     - Movement type (pendulum, circular, vertical, horizontal, straightening, mixed)
     - Directionality (bidirectional, unidirectional, cyclical)
     - ROM/distance thresholds
     - Rep cooldown timing
   - Provides confidence score and reasoning

3. **Adaptive Rep Detector** (`CustomRepDetector.swift`)
   - Dynamically adjusts detection algorithm based on AI-analyzed parameters
   - Handheld mode: Processes ARKit position data with axis-specific detection
   - Camera mode: Processes Vision keypoints with joint-specific ROM tracking
   - Peak-valley detection with configurable thresholds
   - Circular motion detection with angle wrap-around handling

4. **Persistence** (`CustomExerciseManager.swift`)
   - Saves custom exercises to UserDefaults
   - Tracks completion statistics (times completed, average ROM, average SPARC)
   - Observable pattern for UI updates

5. **UI Components**
   - `CustomExerciseCreatorView`: Natural language input with AI analysis preview
   - `CustomExerciseGameView`: Unified game view with timer, rep tracking, ROM display
   - `CustomExerciseCard`: Display card in Exercises tab with stats and context menu

## AI Prompt Engineering

### Prompt Structure
- **Context**: Expert physical therapist analyzing shoulder rehab
- **Input**: User's exercise description
- **Output**: Structured JSON with 9 parameters + confidence + reasoning
- **Guidelines**: Detailed rules for each parameter (tracking mode, joint, movement type, thresholds)

### Example Prompts & Responses

**Input:** "I want to raise both arms overhead like reaching for something"

**AI Output:**
```json
{
  "exerciseName": "Overhead Reach",
  "trackingMode": "camera",
  "jointToTrack": "armpit",
  "movementType": "vertical",
  "directionality": "bidirectional",
  "minimumROMThreshold": 55,
  "minimumDistanceThreshold": null,
  "repCooldown": 1.8,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Clear vertical elevation motion suitable for camera tracking. Armpit joint captures shoulder elevation ROM. Bidirectional counts full up+down cycle."
}
```

**Input:** "Make circular motions with my phone like stirring a pot"

**AI Output:**
```json
{
  "exerciseName": "Circular Stirring",
  "trackingMode": "handheld",
  "jointToTrack": null,
  "movementType": "circular",
  "directionality": "cyclical",
  "minimumROMThreshold": 40,
  "minimumDistanceThreshold": 25,
  "repCooldown": 2.0,
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "reasoning": "Handheld circular motion detected. Device tracks 3D circular path. Cyclical counting for continuous rotations."
}
```

## Rep Detection Algorithms

### Handheld Mode (ARKit Position Tracking)

**Pendulum Detection:**
- Tracks Z-axis (forward/backward)
- Peak-valley state machine
- Threshold: distance traveled (cm)

**Circular Detection:**
- Calculates angle in XZ plane
- Detects 360° rotations via wrap-around
- ROM = max radius during session

**Vertical Detection:**
- Tracks Y-axis (up/down)
- Similar to pendulum but vertical plane

**Horizontal Detection:**
- Tracks X-axis (side-to-side)
- Lateral abduction/adduction

### Camera Mode (Vision Keypoints)

**Armpit Tracking:**
- Uses `keypoints.getArmpitROM(side:)`
- Shoulder elevation angle

**Elbow Tracking:**
- Uses `keypoints.getLeftElbowAngle()` or `getRightElbowAngle()`
- Flexion/extension cycles

---

## UI/UX Updates

### Navigation Rename
- "Fitness" → "Exercises"
- Tab icon: `gamecontroller.fill` → `figure.strengthtraining.traditional`
- "All Exercises" → "Built-In Exercises" (when custom exercises exist)

### Add Button (+)
- Green circular button in top-right corner
- Next to "Exercises" header
- Prominent shadow for visibility

### Custom Exercise Cards
- Display name, brief description (mode · joint · movement)
- Completion badge (checkmark + count) or "New" badge
- Custom color based on movement type
- Context menu for deletion
- Appears in "Your Custom Exercises" section above built-in exercises

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Motion Tracking Integration

**Handheld Mode:**
```swift
motionService.arkitTracker.onTransformUpdate = { transform, timestamp in
    let position = simd_float3(transform.columns.3.x, .y, .z)
    customRepDetector.processHandheldPosition(position, timestamp)
}
```

**Camera Mode:**
```swift
customRepDetector.processCameraKeypoints(keypoints, timestamp)
```

### State Machine (Rep Detection)
```
idle → ascending → descending → idle
              ↓         ↓
         (peak)    (valley)
```

**Bidirectional:** Counts valley (full cycle)  
**Unidirectional:** Counts peak only  
**Cyclical:** Continuous cycles (circular)

### Data Persistence
- Exercises saved to UserDefaults as JSON
- Key: `"com.flexa.customExercises"`
- Auto-updates on completion with rolling averages

8. **Historical Trends**: Track ROM/SPARC improvement over time per exercise
9. **Smart Suggestions**: AI recommends complementary exercises based on completed ones
10. **Offline Mode**: Cache common exercise patterns for offline analysis
