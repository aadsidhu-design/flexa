## 5. âœ… ARKit Optimization - 60fps High Quality

### Optimizations Applied
**File:** `InstantARKitTracker.swift`

âœ… **60fps Video Format Selection:**
```swift
// Prioritizes 60fps formats for smooth, responsive tracking
let supportedFormats = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.supportedVideoFormats
if let format60fps = supportedFormats.first(where: { $0.framesPerSecond == 60 }) {
    config.videoFormat = format60fps
}
```

âœ… **High Resolution Fallback:**
```swift
// Falls back to highest resolution if 60fps unavailable
else if let highResFormat = supportedFormats.max(by: { 
    $0.imageResolution.width < $1.imageResolution.width 
}) {
    config.videoFormat = highResFormat
}
```

âœ… **Applied To:**
- `start()` - Initial session setup
- `resetTracking()` - Between reps
- `sessionInterruptionEnded()` - Recovery from interruptions

âœ… **Quality Settings:**
- World alignment: Gravity
- Auto-focus: Enabled
- Plane detection: Disabled (performance optimization)
- Instant tracking: No anchor delays

---

## 6. âœ… Image Quality & Pose Detection

### MediaPipe Configuration
**File:** `MediaPipePoseProvider.swift`

- Confidence thresholds optimized for real-world scenarios:
  - Detection: 0.3 (lowered for better coverage)
  - Presence: 0.3 (handles tilted poses)
  - Tracking: 0.3 (continuous tracking)

âœ… **Image Preprocessing:**
- Proper orientation correction
- Maintains aspect ratio
- Color space normalization
- Optional brightness/contrast adjustment for low-light

âœ… **Camera Resolution:**
- VGA 640x480 (`.vga640x480`)
- Optimal balance: quality vs performance
- Matches MediaPipe recommended input size
- 30 FPS processing (prevents frame dropping)
