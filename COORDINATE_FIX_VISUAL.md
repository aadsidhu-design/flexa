# 📐 Coordinate Mapping Fix - Visual Guide

## BEFORE (BROKEN) ❌

```
User's Hand Movement          →    On-Screen Pin/Circle
┌─────────────────┐                ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │                │   ⭕ PIN        │
│  Hand UP ⬆️      │           →    │   (going DOWN)  │
│                 │                │        ⬇️        │
└─────────────────┘                └─────────────────┘

INVERTED! Wrong! Frustrating!
```

## AFTER (FIXED) ✅

```
User's Hand Movement          →    On-Screen Pin/Circle  
┌─────────────────┐                ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │                │        ⬆️        │
│  Hand UP ⬆️      │           →    │   (going UP)    │
│                 │                │   ⭕ PIN        │
└─────────────────┘                └─────────────────┘

CORRECT! Synchronous! Intuitive!

## Arm Raises (Constellation) Game

### BEFORE (BROKEN) ❌

```
❌ Must start from dot #0 (forced path)
❌ Dots move around when selected  
❌ No line following hand
❌ Unclear rep counting

   ⚪ ← Must start here
   ⚪
   ⚪
```

### AFTER (FIXED) ✅

```
✅ Start from ANY dot
✅ Dots LOCKED in position
✅ Line follows hand dynamically
✅ Each connection = 1 rep

   ⚪ ← Can start here
   ⚪ ← Or here
   ⚪ ← Or anywhere!

Connect: A → B → C = 2 reps (AB + BC)
```

## Service Lifecycle

### BEFORE (BROKEN) ❌

```
Game Running  →  Game Ends  →  Analyzing Screen
   📹 ON          📹 STILL ON     📹 STILL ON ❌
   🎮 ON          🎮 STILL ON     🎮 STILL ON ❌
                                 (Battery drain!)
```

### AFTER (FIXED) ✅

```
Game Running  →  Game Ends  →  Analyzing Screen
   📹 ON          📹 OFF ✅       📹 OFF ✅
   🎮 ON          🎮 OFF ✅       🎮 OFF ✅
                                 (Clean shutdown!)

## Coordinate System Reference

### Vision Camera (Front-Facing)
```
     Y (0)
      ↓
X(0)→ ┌─────┐
      │     │  640x480 (landscape)
      │  📷  │  Mirrored horizontally
      │     │  Rotated 90° for portrait
      └─────┘
         ↑
     Y (640)
```

### Screen (Portrait Mode)
```
        X (0)
          ↓
      ┌───────┐
Y(0)→ │       │ 390x844
      │   📱  │ Portrait orientation
      │       │ Y goes downward
      └───────┘
         ↑
      X (390)
```

### Mapping Logic
```
Vision X → Screen Y (with inversion)
Vision Y → Screen X (with mirroring)

Hand UP (Vision X↓) → Pin UP (Screen Y↓) ✅
```

## Testing Quick Reference

### ✅ Works Now
- Arm Raises coordinate mapping
- Arm Raises dot selection
- Arm Raises rep counting
- Service cleanup

### ⏳ Needs Testing
- Balloon Pop pin (should be ONE)
- Follow Circle direction (clockwise/CCW)
- Circular rep counting (should be accurate)
- Wall Climbers (should work with Y-fix)

### 🔧 Easy to Fix
- Wall Climbers timer removal
- Data export confirmation
- Game instructions
- Skip survey goal update
