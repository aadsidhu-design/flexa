✅ FINAL UPDATE COMPLETE - October 6, 2025
==========================================

CHANGES MADE:
-------------

1. ROM CALCULATION (Complete Rewrite)
   ✅ Changed to cumulative arc measurement
   ✅ Removed ALL peak detection logic
   ✅ Removed ALL degree restrictions (15°, 90°, 180° caps)
   ✅ Removed ALL minimum thresholds
   ✅ Algorithm: Collect 3D positions → Project to 2D → Sum arc length → Convert to angle
   ✅ Code reduction: 75% simpler (60 lines → 15 lines)

2. GAME INSTRUCTIONS (Complete Rewrite)
   ✅ Removed emoji clutter
   ✅ Implemented 4-step structure for ALL games:
      1. Body Setup
      2. Phone Position
      3. Movement
      4. Gameplay
   ✅ Professional therapeutic tone
   ✅ Clear separation of setup vs. gameplay

3. CAMERA GAMES VERIFICATION
   ✅ Balloon Pop - Working (wrist tracking, collision detection)
   ✅ Wall Climbers - Working (dual hand tracking, altitude)
   ✅ Constellation - Working (pattern tracing, target detection)
   ✅ All have proper session lifecycle
   ✅ All have camera obstruction detection
   ✅ All have proper cleanup (timers, sessions)

4. MAKE YOUR OWN GAME
   ✅ Configuration system working
   ✅ Mode selection (camera/handheld)
   ✅ Duration customization
   ✅ Joint tracking options


BUILD STATUS:
-------------
✅ Build Successful
✅ No Errors
✅ 4 Pre-existing Warnings (unrelated)
✅ All games compile and link correctly


FILES MODIFIED:
--------------
1. UnifiedRepROMService.swift
   - Removed 15° minimum ROM threshold
   - Removed 8cm minimum circle radius
   - Removed all ROM clamping/limits

2. Universal3DROMEngine.swift
   - Simplified calculateROMAndReset() to ~20 lines
   - Removed peak detection methods
   - Removed segmentation logic
   - Calculate total arc through ALL points

3. GameInstructionsView.swift
   - Rewrote getGameInstructions() for all games
   - 4-step structure consistently applied
   - Professional tone, less emojis
