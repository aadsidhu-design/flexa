# ARKit and Rep Detection Audit

This document summarizes the code audit and enhancements made to the ARKit integration, 3D position tracking, Range of Motion (ROM), and rep counting systems. The goal of this audit was to verify and improve the correctness, performance, and observability of these critical features.

## Summary of Changes

Detailed logging has been added to the following files to provide a clear view into the system's behavior:

-   `InstantARKitTracker.swift`: The core ARKit integration class.
-   `HandheldRepDetector.swift`: The class responsible for detecting reps in handheld mode.
-   `HandheldROMCalculator.swift`: The class that calculates ROM for handheld mode.

These logs are designed to be read in the device console and will help you verify that the system is working as expected.

## How to Use the New Logs

To view the logs, run the app on a physical device connected to Xcode. The logs will appear in the Xcode console. You can filter the logs by the prefixes `游늸 [AUDIT]`, `游대 [AUDIT]`, and `游늻 [AUDIT]` to see the relevant output from each component.

### 1. Verifying ARKit and 3D Positions

The logs in `InstantARKitTracker.swift` will help you verify that ARKit is working correctly.

-   **Initialization:** Look for logs that indicate ARKit is starting and initializing. You should see messages about the ARKit version, whether LiDAR is being used, and when the session is fully initialized.
    -   `游늸 [AUDIT] InstantARKitTracker initialized. ARKit version: 6.0`
    -   `游늸 [AUDIT] LiDAR supported and enabled.` or `游늸 [AUDIT] LiDAR not supported.`
    -   `游늸 [AUDIT] ARKit fully initialized after 0.XXXs. Position updates are now being sent.`
-   **3D Positions:** The tracker will now log the 3D position every 30 frames (approximately every 0.5 seconds). This allows you to see the raw position data being generated by ARKit.
    -   `游늸 [AUDIT] 3D Position: (X.XXX, Y.XXX, Z.XXX) | Tracking: Normal`
-   **Tracking State:** Any changes in the ARKit tracking state will be logged, so you can see if the system is having trouble tracking the environment.
    -   `游늸 [AUDIT] ARKit Tracking state changed: Normal`
    -   `游늸 [AUDIT] ARKit Tracking state changed: Limited(Insufficient Features)`

### 2. Verifying Rep Detection

The logs in `HandheldRepDetector.swift` will show you how reps are being detected.

-   **Game Parameters:** When a game starts, the rep detector will log the game type and the parameters being used for detection.
    -   `游대 [AUDIT] RepDetector started for game: FruitSlicer. Cooldown: 0.25s, Min Velocity: 0.0005`
-   **Rep Counting:** When a rep is counted, the log will explain *why* it was counted.
    -   `游대 [AUDIT] Pendulum rep counted. Reason: Direction change detected.`
    -   `游대 [AUDIT] Circular rep counted. Reason: Rotation threshold met (X.XXrad).`
-   **Rep Incremented:** You will see a log every time the rep count is incremented.
    -   `游대 [AUDIT] Rep count incremented to X.`

### 3. Verifying ROM Calculation

The logs in `HandheldROMCalculator.swift` will provide insight into the ROM calculation process.

-   **Motion Profile:** When a session starts, the calculator will log which motion profile (`pendulum`, `circular`, or `freeform`) is being used.
    -   `游늻 [AUDIT] ROMCalculator session started. Profile: pendulum, Arm Length: 0.70m`
-   **ROM Calculation:** The logs will show the inputs and outputs of the ROM calculation methods, so you can see how the final ROM value is derived.
    -   `游늻 [AUDIT] ROM from Arc Length: XX.X춿 (Arc: X.XXXm, Arm: 0.70m)`
    -   `游늻 [AUDIT] ROM from Radius: XX.X춿 (Radius: X.XXXm, Arm: 0.70m)`
-   **Rep Completion and Reset:** When a rep is completed, the calculator will log the final ROM for that rep and indicate that it is resetting its state for the next rep. This confirms the "rep resets ROM" behavior.
    -   `游늻 [AUDIT] Rep completed. Calculated ROM: XX.X춿. Resetting for next rep.`

## How "Rep Resets ROM" Works

The user was concerned about how ROM is calculated for each rep. Based on the code audit, here is how it works:

1.  When a rep is detected by `HandheldRepDetector`, it calls the `completeRep()` method in `HandheldROMCalculator`.
2.  The `HandheldROMCalculator` then calculates the final ROM for the just-completed rep based on the motion data (positions) it has collected since the last rep.
3.  After calculating the ROM, it **resets its internal state**, including the `currentRepPositions`, `currentRepTimestamps`, and `currentRepArcLength`.
4.  This means that the ROM for each rep is calculated independently, based only on the motion that occurred during that specific rep. The ROM from one rep does not affect the calculation of the next.

This "reset" mechanism ensures that each rep's ROM is a distinct measurement, which is the desired behavior. The new logs will allow you to observe this process in real-time.
