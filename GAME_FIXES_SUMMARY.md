# Game Fixes Summary - Complete Audit & Fixes

## âœ… 1. Fruit Slicer Game - FIXED

### Issue 1: Slicer Movement Too Limited
**Problem:** Slicer didn't move up and down enough, making it hard to hit fruits.

**Fix in `OptimizedFruitSlicerGameView.swift`:**
- âœ… Increased acceleration multiplier from 1.0 to **2.5** for more responsive movement
- âœ… Reduced damping from 0.92 to **0.88** for more dynamic motion  
- âœ… Reduced maxVelocity from 0.7 to **0.45** (lower = more movement per unit velocity)
- âœ… Increased movement range from 55% to **75%** of available height
- âœ… Reduced padding from 100 to **80** pixels for more vertical range
- âœ… Increased smoothing factor from 0.22 to **0.35** for more responsive motion

### Issue 2: ROM Accumulation (360Â° Cap)
**Problem:** ROM would accumulate to 360Â° and stay there, not resetting between reps.

**Fix in `HandheldRepDetector.swift`:**
- âœ… Added `romResetCallback` property to allow external ROM reset
- âœ… Modified `incrementRep()` to call `romResetCallback?()` before incrementing rep count
- âœ… Added `resetRepState()` call to clear pendulum tracking state

**Fix in `HandheldROMCalculator.swift`:**
- âœ… Added `resetLiveROM()` method to immediately reset ROM to 0Â° for instant UI feedback
- âœ… Existing `completeRep()` method already had proper baseline reset logic

**Fix in `SimpleMotionService.swift`:**
- âœ… Hooked up `romResetCallback` to call `handheldROMCalculator.resetLiveROM()`
- âœ… Ensures ROM resets between every rep for accurate per-rep tracking

### Issue 3: Game End on 3 Bombs
**Problem:** Game should end immediately when 3rd bomb is hit and go to analyzing screen.

**Fix in `OptimizedFruitSlicerGameView.swift`:**
- âœ… Removed unnecessary 0.02s delay before calling `endGame()`
- âœ… Game now ends immediately when 3rd bomb is hit
- âœ… Properly transitions to analyzing screen via `NavigationCoordinator.shared.showAnalyzing()`

---

## âœ… 2. Constellation Game - FIXED

### Issue 1: Constellation Points Not Showing
**Problem:** Screen size was zero, so constellation points were positioned at (0,0).

**Fix in `SimplifiedConstellationGameView.swift`:**
- âœ… Wrapped body in `GeometryReader` to capture actual screen size
- âœ… Set `game.screenSize = geometry.size` in `onAppear`
- âœ… Added `onChange(of: geometry.size)` to handle orientation changes
- âœ… Added fallback `UIScreen.main.bounds.size` in `updateHandTracking()` and `generateNewPattern()`

### Issue 2: Hand Tracking Circle Not Showing
**Problem:** Hand position was zero because screen size was zero, preventing coordinate mapping.

**Fix in `SimplifiedConstellationGameView.swift`:**
- âœ… Screen size now properly initialized before hand tracking starts
- âœ… `CoordinateMapper.mapVisionPointToScreen()` now receives valid screen size
- âœ… Hand position circle now displays and follows user's wrist

## âœ… 3. ROM Tracking & Metrics - VERIFIED

### ROM Calculation Flow (Handheld Games)
1. **ARKit Position Data** â†’ `ingestExternalHandheldPosition()` in SimpleMotionService
2. **Position Processing** â†’ `HandheldROMCalculator.processPosition()` calculates live ROM
3. **ROM Updates** â†’ Published to `currentROM` via `onROMUpdated` callback
4. **Rep Detection** â†’ `HandheldRepDetector` detects direction changes
5. **Rep Completion** â†’ Triggers `romResetCallback` â†’ `resetLiveROM()` â†’ ROM resets to 0Â°
6. **ROM Recording** â†’ `completeRep()` calculates final rep ROM and stores in `romPerRep`

### ROM Calculation Flow (Camera Games)
1. **Camera Frames** â†’ MediaPipe Pose Detection â†’ `SimplifiedPoseKeypoints`
2. **Joint Tracking** â†’ `CameraROMCalculator` tracks armpit/elbow angles
3. **ROM Updates** â†’ Published to `currentROM`
4. **Rep Detection** â†’ `CameraRepDetector` validates ROM threshold
5. **Rep Recording** â†’ `recordCameraRepCompletion()` stores ROM in `romPerRep`

### SPARC (Smoothness) Tracking
- **Handheld Games:** ARKit positions fed to `SPARCCalculationService.addARKitPositionData()`
- **Camera Games:** Wrist positions fed to `CameraSmoothnessAnalyzer`
- **Per-Rep SPARC:** Calculated and stored in `sparcHistory` array
- **Timeline Data:** Available for detailed smoothness graphs

### Session Data Collection
All metrics properly collected and passed to analyzing screen:
- âœ… `reps` - Total repetition count
- âœ… `maxROM` - Maximum ROM achieved
- âœ… `averageROM` - Average ROM across all reps
- âœ… `romHistory` - ROM value for each rep
- âœ… `sparcHistory` - SPARC value for each rep
- âœ… `repTimestamps` - Timestamp for each rep
- âœ… `duration` - Total session duration
- âœ… `score` - Game-specific score

## âœ… 5. Session End & Data Handoff

### Game End Flow
1. Game detects end condition (3 bombs, 3 patterns, etc.)
2. Calls `motionService.getFullSessionData()` to snapshot all metrics
3. Calls `motionService.stopSession()` to clean up
4. Posts notification with session data
5. Navigates to `AnalyzingView` with `ExerciseSessionData`

### Data Integrity Checks
- âœ… ROM values validated (0-180Â° range)
- âœ… SPARC values validated (finite numbers only)
- âœ… Empty arrays handled gracefully
- âœ… Timestamps properly recorded
- âœ… Session ID generated for tracking
