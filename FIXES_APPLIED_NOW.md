# Comprehensive Game Fixes - Implementation Log

## Date: $(date)

### FIXES APPLIED:

#### 1. FollowCircleGameView - FIXED INVERTED MOVEMENT
- Changed `screenDeltaY = -relZ * gain` to `screenDeltaY = relZ * gain`
- NOW: User moves hand forward → cursor moves DOWN (natural circular motion)
- NOW: Clockwise hand motion → clockwise cursor motion

#### 2. FollowCircleGameView - FIXED REP OVERCOUNTING  
- Increased `minCompletionAngle` from 320° to 350° (almost full circle required)
- Increased `minCircleRadius` from 60px to 80px (larger circles = better quality)
- Decreased `maxCircleTime` from 10s to 8s (must complete circle faster)
- Result: Much stricter validation prevents 14 reps for 1-2 circles
