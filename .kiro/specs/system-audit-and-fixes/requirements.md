# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive audit and fix of critical systems in the FlexaSwiftUI app including AI scoring accuracy, SPARC smoothness graphing, custom exercise robustness, circle ROM accuracy, metrics collection/calculation, and data upload integrity to Appwrite (formerly Firebase).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AI Score System Accuracy

**User Story:** As a physical therapy patient, I want accurate AI scoring of my exercise form so that I receive meaningful feedback on my performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI scores are calculated THEN they SHALL reflect actual exercise quality accurately
2. WHEN the system generates scores THEN it SHALL use validated algorithms and not placeholder values
3. WHEN scores are displayed THEN they SHALL correlate with observable exercise performance
4. WHEN AI scoring fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful fallback scoring
5. WHEN scores are saved THEN they SHALL be based on real motion analysis data

### Requirement 2: SPARC Smoothness Calculation and Graphing

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to see accurate smoothness metrics and graphs so that I can assess patient movement quality over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SPARC calculations are performed THEN they SHALL produce mathematically correct smoothness values
2. WHEN smoothness data is graphed THEN the visualization SHALL display accurate trend lines
3. WHEN smoothness metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be stored with proper timestamps
4. WHEN graphs are rendered THEN they SHALL show meaningful data points without gaps or errors
5. WHEN smoothness analysis fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide fallback metrics

### Requirement 3: Custom Exercise System Robustness

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create any type of custom exercise with proper rep counting and tracking so that I can personalize my therapy routine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users create custom exercises THEN the system SHALL support any movement pattern
2. WHEN rep counting occurs THEN it SHALL accurately detect exercise repetitions
3. WHEN custom exercises are saved THEN all configuration data SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN custom exercises are loaded THEN they SHALL function identically to built-in exercises
5. WHEN edge cases occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashes

### Requirement 4: Circle ROM Accuracy

**User Story:** As a user performing circular movements, I want precise ROM measurements so that my circular exercise progress is tracked correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN circular ROM is calculated THEN it SHALL measure the full range of circular motion
2. WHEN circle exercises are performed THEN ROM tracking SHALL account for 360-degree movements
3. WHEN circular patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL distinguish them from linear movements
4. WHEN ROM values are displayed THEN they SHALL reflect actual circular range achieved
5. WHEN circular calibration occurs THEN it SHALL establish accurate baseline measurements

### Requirement 5: Metrics Collection and Calculation Integrity

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider analyzing patient data, I want all exercise metrics to be calculated correctly and stored reliably so that treatment decisions are based on accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exercise sessions occur THEN all relevant metrics SHALL be collected automatically
2. WHEN calculations are performed THEN they SHALL use validated mathematical formulas
3. WHEN metrics are updated THEN they SHALL reflect real-time exercise performance
4. WHEN data is aggregated THEN it SHALL maintain accuracy across all calculation steps
5. WHEN metrics are retrieved THEN they SHALL match the original collected values

### Requirement 6: Firebase Data Upload Integrity

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my exercise data to be safely stored in the cloud so that my progress is never lost and is available across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN session data is uploaded THEN it SHALL contain all collected metrics without data loss
2. WHEN uploads occur THEN they SHALL not contain fake, placeholder, or corrupted data
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL retry uploads with proper error handling
4. WHEN data is synchronized THEN it SHALL maintain consistency between local and cloud storage
5. WHEN upload verification occurs THEN the system SHALL confirm successful data transmission

### Requirement 7: Production-Level System Reliability

**User Story:** As a user relying on this app for my therapy, I want all systems to work reliably in real-world conditions so that my treatment is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system component fails THEN it SHALL degrade gracefully without affecting other systems
2. WHEN edge cases are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle them without crashes
3. WHEN data validation occurs THEN it SHALL prevent invalid data from corrupting the system
4. WHEN error conditions arise THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
5. WHEN system recovery is needed THEN it SHALL restore functionality automatically when possible
