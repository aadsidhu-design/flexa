📐 ROM CALCULATION ALGORITHM - VISUAL COMPARISON
=================================================

OLD APPROACH (Peak-to-Peak):
----------------------------
Phone movement in space:
    
    Start ●─────────►Peak1 ●──────►Valley ●──────►Peak2 ●
           segment1       segment2      segment3
    
    ROM = segment between Peak1 and Peak2
    ❌ Problem: Misses initial movement from Start to Peak1
    ❌ Problem: Complex peak detection logic
    ❌ Problem: Segmentation can lose information


NEW APPROACH (Full Arc - SIMPLE!):
----------------------------------
Phone movement in space:
    
    Start ●─────►─────►─────►─────►─────►End
          └────── entire arc drawn ──────┘
    
    ROM = total arc length through ALL points
    ✅ Phone draws arc in 3D space
    ✅ Project to 2D to remove tilt
    ✅ Measure ENTIRE arc length
    ✅ That's it! No peaks, no segmentation!


CONCRETE EXAMPLE - Pendulum Swing:
----------------------------------
Phone positions (2D projected): 
[P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5]
 0m  0.1m 0.2m 0.35m 0.28m 0.15m

OLD METHOD:
- Detect peaks: Find local maxima → Complex!
- Need 2+ peaks → Sometimes fails
- ROM = arc between peaks → Incomplete!

NEW METHOD:
- Arc = |P1-P0| + |P2-P1| + |P3-P2| + |P4-P3| + |P5-P4|
- Arc = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.15 + 0.07 + 0.13 = 0.55m
- ROM = (0.55 / 0.75) × 180/π = 41.9°
- DONE! ✨


FORMULA BREAKDOWN:
-----------------
Step 1: Collect 3D positions as phone moves
   positions3D = [pos1, pos2, pos3, ...]

Step 2: Project to optimal 2D plane
   positions2D = project(positions3D)

Step 3: Calculate TOTAL arc length
   arcLength = Σ distance(pos[i], pos[i-1]) for all i

Step 4: Convert to angle
   ROM = (arcLength / armRadius) × (180 / π)
   
   Where armRadius = calibratedArmLength + 0.15m gripOffset


WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH:
-------------------------------
✅ Matches reality: Phone literally draws an arc in space
✅ Simple as possible: No complex peak detection
✅ Complete measurement: Every point matters
✅ Robust: Works for any movement pattern
✅ Intuitive: "Measure the arc I drew" - that's it!


COMPARISON TO DRAWING:
---------------------
Think of it like drawing with a pen:

OLD WAY:
- Try to find the "important" parts of your drawing
- Only measure between those parts
- Miss some of the actual drawing

NEW WAY:
- Just measure the ENTIRE line you drew
- Simple, complete, accurate!


CODE SIMPLICITY:
---------------
Old: ~60 lines with peak detection, segmentation, validation
New: ~15 lines - project, loop through points, sum distances, convert

That's a 75% reduction in code complexity!


LOGGING OUTPUT:
--------------
You'll see:
📐 [ROM-FullArc] 120 points, TotalArc=0.234m, Radius=0.75m → ROM=17.9°

This tells you:
- Total points in the movement
- Complete arc length measured
- Arm radius used
- Final ROM calculated
