# Velocity-Based Rep Detection + Improved Instructions ✅

## Date: October 4, 2025

## Problem Solved

### The REAL Issue with Fruit Slicer:
**NOT**: "Thresholds are too high" ❌  
**ACTUALLY**: "It's detecting reps mid-swing because it measures distance from a FIXED point" ❌

**Example**:
```
User swings 90° forward:
├─ 0-20°: Distance from start = 0.18m → Rep #1 counted ❌
└─ 20-90°: Distance from start = 0.45m → Rep #2 counted ❌

Result: 2 reps for 1 swing ❌
```

**Root Cause**: Peak detection uses **distance from fixed start point**, which keeps growing during a single swing!

## The Solution: Velocity-Based Direction Reversal

### Key Insight:
**Don't measure distance from a point - measure VELOCITY DIRECTION CHANGES!**

### How It Works:
```
1. Track last 8 positions (~0.13 seconds)
2. Calculate movement vector: newPos - oldPos
3. Calculate velocity: distance / time
4. Detect direction reversal:
   - Compare current direction with last direction
   - If dot product < -0.3 → directions are opposite → REP! ✅
5. Works for ANY swing size (small or large!)
```

### Visual Example:
```
Forward swing:  →→→→→ (velocity vector pointing right)
Peak reached:   →→•
Backward swing: ←←←←← (velocity reverses!)
                     ↑
                Direction reversal detected → Count 1 rep ✅
```

## New Algorithm Details

### Parameters (VERY Lenient!):
```swift
minSwingDistance: 8cm       // Works for tiny therapeutic swings!
velocityThreshold: 0.15 m/s // Slow movements OK
minROM: 10°                 // Accepts small range exercises
minTimeBetweenReps: 0.25s   // Fast debounce
```

### Direction Reversal Detection:
```swift
dotProduct = current_direction · last_direction

if dotProduct < -0.3:  // 110° or more angle change
    → Opposite directions detected
    → Count rep ✅
```

**Why Dot Product?**
- `1.0` = Same direction (parallel)
- `0.0` = Perpendicular (90°)
- `-1.0` = Opposite direction (180°)
- `-0.3` = ~110° angle change (reversal!)

### Velocity Calculation:
```swift
movementVector = newPosition - oldPosition
velocity = distance / timeSpan (0.13s)

if velocity >= 0.15 m/s:
    → Real movement (not noise)
    → Consider for rep detection
```

## Why This Works for ALL Swing Sizes

### Small Swing (20°, 0.12m):
```
Forward:  →→→ (velocity = 0.18 m/s)
Reversal: •
Backward: ←←← (velocity = 0.16 m/s, dot product = -0.45)
          ↑
Result: 1 rep counted ✅ (meets 8cm + 0.15m/s thresholds!)
```

### Large Swing (90°, 0.50m):
```
Forward:  →→→→→→→ (velocity = 0.85 m/s)
Reversal: •
Backward: ←←←←←←← (velocity = 0.78 m/s, dot product = -0.92)
          ↑
Result: 1 rep counted ✅
```

### Mid-Swing Movement (NOT a reversal):
```
Position: →→→→→→→ (still going same direction)
No velocity reversal detected
Result: 0 reps ✅ (correctly ignored!)
```

## Improved Instructions for ALL Games

### 🍎 Fruit Slicer (Pendulum Swings)
**Before**: "Hold phone flat, swing forward/back"
**After**:
```
🪑 SIT and REST your elbow on a CHAIR ARM or TABLE EDGE for support
📱 Hold phone FLAT (screen facing up) - arm hangs relaxed like a pendulum
🍎 SWING arm FORWARD then BACK - each direction change = 1 rep (small or large swings OK!)
⭐ Game ends after 3 bomb hits. Smooth rhythm matters more than speed!
```

### 🔄 Follow Circle (Circular Motion)
**Before**: "Move arm in circles"
**After**:
```
🪑 SIT and REST your elbow/forearm on a CHAIR or TABLE
📱 Hold phone VERTICAL (screen facing you) in relaxed grip
🔄 Draw CIRCLES with your hand - green cursor tracks your motion (stay inside white ring!)
⭐ One COMPLETE circle = 1 rep. Bigger, smoother circles = better ROM score!
```

### 🏔️ Wall Climbers (Camera - Arm Raises)
**Before**: "Prop phone, raise arms"
**After**:
```
📱 PROP phone UPRIGHT 3-5 feet away - front camera must see your WHOLE UPPER BODY
🙆 Stand facing camera - raise BOTH arms STRAIGHT UP overhead, then lower to sides
🏔️ Arms up = climb altitude! Arms down = lose altitude. Goal: reach 1000m summit!
⭐ NO rush! Slow, controlled raises with FULL range = fastest climbing!
```

### ⭐ Constellation (Camera - Precise Wrist Tracking)
**Before**: "Move arm to touch dots"
**After**:
```
📱 PROP phone UPRIGHT 3-5 feet away - camera sees your FULL UPPER BODY and arms
✋ Move your hand/wrist - CYAN CIRCLE tracks it precisely on screen
⭐ Touch constellation dots IN ORDER (1→2→3...) - cyan line shows when you're close
🎯 Complete 3 patterns. NO TIMER - smooth, controlled movements score best!
```

### 🎈 Balloon Pop (Camera - Elbow Extension)
**Before**: "Raise arm, extend elbow"
**After**:
```
📱 PROP phone UPRIGHT 3-5 feet away - camera must see your ARM and SHOULDER clearly
💪 RAISE arm UP and STRAIGHTEN ELBOW fully - cyan pin at wrist pops balloons
🎈 Pin tracks your wrist - reach HIGH to pop balloons at screen top (full extension!)
⭐ Straighten elbow completely each time = maximum ROM score. Pop all balloons to win!
```

### 🔥 Fan the Flame (Handheld - Side Swings)
**Before**: "Swing horizontally"
**After**:
```
📱 Hold phone UPRIGHT in hand (screen facing you, comfortable grip)
💨 SWING arm SIDE-TO-SIDE across your body - like fanning a campfire
🔥 Each swing direction = 1 rep. Flame shrinks with each swing. Extinguish to win!
⭐ Small or big swings both count! Smooth, steady rhythm = best smoothness score!
```

### 🎮 Make Your Own (Custom Exercises)
**Before**: "Choose mode, follow instructions"
**After**:
```
📱 Choose CAMERA mode (prop phone upright, camera sees you) OR HANDHELD (hold phone)
🎮 CAMERA: Tracks your body joints. HANDHELD: Tracks phone movement in your hand
📋 Follow on-screen prompts for your selected exercise type
⭐ Fully customizable duration and intensity - perfect for YOUR therapy needs!
```

   - Console: `🎯 [Pendulum] Rep #1 ⇄ — vel=0.18m/s ROM=20.0°`
   - **No false negatives!**

### Test Case 2: Large Full Swing (90°, 0.50m)
1. Make full pendulum swing (maximum ROM)
2. **Expected**: 
   - ✅ **1 rep per direction** (forward = 1, back = 1)
   - Console: `🎯 [Pendulum] Rep #2 ↔ — vel=0.85m/s ROM=90.0°`

### Test Case 3: Continuous Swinging
1. Swing forward → back → forward → back (4 direction changes)
2. **Expected**: 
   - ✅ **4 reps total**
   - Each reversal counts once
   - No mid-swing counting!

### Test Case 4: Noise/Jitter (shake phone while stationary)

## Console Logs

### What You'll See:
```
🎯 [Pendulum] Rep #1 ⇄ — vel=0.18m/s ROM=22.5° (small swing)
🎯 [Pendulum] Rep #2 ↔ — vel=0.42m/s ROM=58.3° (medium swing)
🎯 [Pendulum] Rep #3 ⇄ — vel=0.78m/s ROM=87.1° (large swing)
```

**Symbols**:
- `⇄` = Mild direction change (110-150° angle)
- `↔` = Strong reversal (150-180° angle)

### What You WON'T See:
```
❌ Rep #1 — distance=0.18m ROM=20° (mid-swing)
❌ Rep #2 — distance=0.45m ROM=70° (same swing!)
```

## Math Behind It

### Dot Product Formula:
```
a · b = |a| × |b| × cos(θ)

For normalized vectors (length = 1):
a · b = cos(θ)

θ = 0°   → dot = 1.0  (same direction)
θ = 90°  → dot = 0.0  (perpendicular)
θ = 110° → dot = -0.3 (reversal threshold!)
θ = 180° → dot = -1.0 (opposite)
```

### Why -0.3?
- Allows some natural curve in pendulum motion
- Not too strict (would miss swings)
- Not too loose (would count noise)
- **110° angle change = clear intentional reversal**
