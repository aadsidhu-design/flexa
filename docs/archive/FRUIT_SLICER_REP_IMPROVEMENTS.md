# Fruit Slicer Rep Detection - Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Better Signal Processing

**Larger Sample Window:**
```swift
// OLD: 8 samples
// NEW: 12 samples for better signal stability
let recentSamples = Array(motionSamples.suffix(12))
```

**Total Magnitude Check:**
```swift
// OLD: Only checked Z-axis
let forwardMagnitude = abs(forwardAccel)

// NEW: Check total acceleration magnitude too
let totalMagnitude = simd_length(newAccel)
if forwardMagnitude >= threshold && totalMagnitude >= threshold * 0.8 {
    // Valid swing detected
}
```

This prevents false positives from:
- Pure hand shake (high frequency, low magnitude)
- Tilting phone without swinging
- Accidental bumps

### 2. Hysteresis Thresholds

**Dual Threshold System:**
```swift
// OLD: Single threshold (0.12g)
if accelMagnitude >= threshold { /* peak */ }
if accelMagnitude < threshold * 0.6 { /* valley */ }

// NEW: Separate peak and valley thresholds
let peakThreshold = 0.10g      // Detect swing start
let valleyThreshold = 0.04g    // Detect swing end (40% of peak)
```

**Why this helps:**
- Prevents bouncing at threshold boundary
- Clear separation between "swinging" and "resting"
- More reliable rep counting

### 3. Peak Validation

**Minimum Peak Requirement:**
```swift
// Check if peak was significant enough before counting rep
if peakAcceleration >= peakThreshold {
    // Valid rep detected!
    return (rom: 0, direction: "→")
} else {
    // Peak wasn't strong enough, reset
    isPeakActive = false
}
```

This prevents counting tiny motions as reps.

### 4. Auto-Reset for Stale Peaks

**Timeout for Old Peaks:**
```swift
// If peak lasted >1 second without reversal, reset
if peakAge > 1.0 && forwardMagnitude < valleyThreshold {
    isPeakActive = false
    peakAcceleration = 0
}
```

**Prevents:**
- Getting stuck in peak state
- Missing reps due to state machine deadlock
- False positives from slow movements

### 5. Lower Thresholds (Tuned Parameters)

**Profile Changes:**
```swift
// OLD:
repThreshold: 0.12g
debounceInterval: 0.30s
minRepLength: 8

// NEW:
repThreshold: 0.10g      // 17% more sensitive
debounceInterval: 0.25s  // 17% faster
minRepLength: 6          // Captures smaller movements
```

**Effect:**
- Detects gentler swings (good for rehab patients)
- Faster rep registration
- Better sensitivity without sacrificing accuracy

## Detection Algorithm Flow

### State Machine:

```
[IDLE]
  ↓ (acceleration > 0.10g && total magnitude > 0.08g)
[PEAK ACTIVE - tracking forward swing]
  ↓ (acceleration crosses zero & drops < 0.04g)
  ↓ (validate: peak was > 0.10g)
[REP DETECTED! ✓]
  ↓
[RESET - ready for next rep]
```

### Example Detection:

```
Time    Forward Accel   State               Action
0.0s    0.02g          IDLE                -
0.1s    0.15g          PEAK ACTIVE         Peak detected (forward)
0.2s    0.18g          PEAK ACTIVE         Peak updated
0.3s    0.12g          PEAK ACTIVE         Descending
0.4s    0.03g          REP DETECTED        Valley reached, direction changed
0.5s    -0.14g         PEAK ACTIVE         Peak detected (backward)
0.6s    -0.17g         PEAK ACTIVE         Peak updated
0.7s    -0.09g         PEAK ACTIVE         Descending
0.8s    0.02g          REP DETECTED        Valley reached, direction changed
```

Each direction reversal = 1 rep

## Improvements Summary

### Better Detection:
✅ Larger sample window (12 vs 8) for stability  
✅ Total magnitude check prevents false positives  
✅ Hysteresis prevents threshold bouncing  
✅ Peak validation ensures meaningful swings

## Expected Behavior

### Small Swings (Gentle Rehab):
- **Old**: Might miss reps < 0.12g
- **New**: Detects reps as low as 0.10g ✓

### Medium Swings (Normal Play):
- **Old**: Works fine
- **New**: Faster response (0.25s vs 0.30s) ✓

### Large Swings (Vigorous Exercise):
- **Old**: Works fine
- **New**: Better peak tracking ✓

### Hand Shake / Noise:
- **Old**: Might count if Z-axis hits 0.12g
- **New**: Filtered out (total magnitude check) ✓

### Slow Tilting:
- **Old**: Could trigger if sustained > 0.12g
- **New**: Auto-reset after 1 second ✓

## Testing Checklist

### Sensitivity Tests:
- [ ] Tiny swing (barely moving) - should NOT count
- [ ] Small swing (gentle rehab) - should count ✓
- [ ] Medium swing (normal) - should count ✓
- [ ] Large swing (vigorous) - should count ✓

### Accuracy Tests:
- [ ] 5 deliberate swings = 5 reps counted ✓
- [ ] 10 deliberate swings = 10 reps counted ✓
- [ ] Hand shake (no swing) = 0 reps ✓
- [ ] Slow tilt (no swing) = 0 reps ✓

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Pause mid-swing (1-2 seconds) - resumes correctly ✓
- [ ] Very slow swing - counts or times out ✓
- [ ] Quick double-swing - both count ✓
- [ ] Mixed speeds - all count ✓

## Technical Details

### Physics Behind Detection:

Pendulum swing creates characteristic acceleration pattern:
```
Forward Swing:  Positive Z-axis acceleration (forward)
Peak:           Deceleration (approaching zero)
Backward Swing: Negative Z-axis acceleration (backward)
Valley:         Deceleration (approaching zero)
```

The detector tracks these peaks and valleys, counting each complete cycle (forward + backward) as one rep.

### Why Z-Axis?

For Fruit Slicer pendulum motion:
- X-axis: Side-to-side (minimal)
- Y-axis: Up-down (some, but not primary)
- **Z-axis: Forward-backward (PRIMARY motion)**

Z-axis captures the main pendulum swing direction.

### Threshold Tuning Rationale:

**0.10g threshold:**
- Gentle rehab swing: ~0.10-0.15g
- Normal swing: ~0.15-0.25g
- Vigorous swing: ~0.25-0.40g
- Hand shake: ~0.05-0.08g (filtered out)

Sweet spot: sensitive enough for rehab, robust against noise.
