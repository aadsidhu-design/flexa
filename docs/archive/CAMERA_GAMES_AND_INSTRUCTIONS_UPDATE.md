# Camera Games & Instructions Update

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… Complete & Tested

## Summary

Updated all game instructions to be more practical and professional, focusing on body setup, phone positioning, and clear gameplay mechanics. Verified all camera games (Balloon Pop, Wall Climbers, Constellation) and Make Your Own game work correctly.

---

## Instructions Improvements

### Before: Emoji-Heavy, Less Structured
Instructions were filled with emojis and lacked clear separation of setup vs. gameplay:
```
ðŸ“± PROP phone VERTICALLY on table/stand/chair so camera sees YOUR FULL BODY
ðŸ™† Raise BOTH arms HIGH above your head, then lower smoothly to sides
```

### After: Professional, 4-Step Structure
Each game now has consistent 4-step instructions:
1. **Body Setup** - How to position yourself
2. **Phone Position** - Where to place/hold the device
3. **Movement** - What to do physically
4. **Gameplay** - How the game mechanics work

---

## Updated Instructions Per Game

### Balloon Pop (Camera Game)
```
1. Body Setup: Stand facing the camera. Position yourself so your arm is fully visible when raised.
2. Phone Position: Prop phone vertically. Front camera should see from your waist to above your head.
3. Movement: Raise arm up and fully extend your elbow. A cyan pin at your wrist tip pops balloons.
4. Gameplay: Move hand up to reach balloons at screen top. Full elbow extension gives maximum ROM. Pop them one at a time.
```

**Game Status**: âœ… Working
- Tracks wrist position with cyan pin visualization
- Proper session start/stop lifecycle
- Camera obstruction detection active
- Cleanup on exit (timers invalidated, session stopped)

---

### Wall Climbers (Camera Game)
```
1. Body Setup: Stand facing the camera, arms at your sides. Ensure full body is visible on screen.
2. Phone Position: Prop phone vertically on a stable surface (table, stand, or chair). Front camera should see your entire upper body.
3. Movement: Raise both arms straight up above your head, then lower smoothly back to sides. Keep movements controlled.
4. Gameplay: Altitude increases as arms rise. Reach 1000m to win. No time limit - focus on full range motion.
```

**Game Status**: âœ… Working
- Tracks both hands with position circles
- Climbing phase detection (going up/down)
- Altitude meter updates based on arm height
- Proper cleanup and session management

---

### Constellation Maker (Camera Game)
```
1. Body Setup: Stand facing the camera with your upper body centered on screen.
2. Phone Position: Prop phone vertically. Front camera must clearly see your shoulders, arms, and hands.
3. Movement: Raise and move your arm. A cyan circle tracks your wrist position precisely.
4. Gameplay: Guide the circle to touch constellation dots in order. Cyan line shows when near target. Complete 3 patterns.
```

**Game Status**: âœ… Working
- Wrist tracking with cyan circle
- Connect-the-dots pattern system
- 3 constellation patterns to complete
- No time limit for therapeutic focus
- Proper session lifecycle

---

### Fruit Slicer (Handheld Game)
```
1. Body Setup: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Relax shoulders and keep good posture.
2. Phone Position: Hold phone firmly in your dominant hand, screen facing you, vertical orientation.
3. Movement: Swing arm smoothly across your body in pendulum motions. Use your whole arm from the shoulder.
4. Gameplay: Slice fruits as they appear. Avoid bombs (3 hits ends game). Smooth swings = better scores.
```

---

### Follow Circle (Handheld Game)
```
1. Body Setup: Stand comfortably with feet shoulder-width apart. Keep core stable.
2. Phone Position: Hold phone normally in dominant hand, screen facing you.
3. Movement: Move your entire arm in large circular motions, like drawing big circles in the air.
4. Gameplay: Keep green cursor inside the white guide circle. Complete full circles for reps. Larger circles = better ROM.
```

---

### Fan Out Flame (Handheld Game)
```
1. Body Setup: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Keep your core engaged for stability.
2. Phone Position: Hold phone securely in dominant hand, screen facing you, vertical orientation.
3. Movement: Swing arm horizontally left and right across your body, like fanning flames.
4. Gameplay: Each complete swing (left or right) reduces the flame. Extinguish it to win. Smooth, consistent swings score best.
```

---

### Make Your Own (Customizable)
```
1. Body Setup: For camera mode - stand facing camera. For handheld mode - stand comfortably with good posture.
2. Phone Position: Camera mode - prop phone vertically on stable surface. Handheld mode - hold phone in dominant hand.
3. Movement: Camera mode tracks shoulder/elbow joints. Handheld mode tracks device motion. Choose based on your exercise type.
4. Gameplay: Set custom duration and movement range. Follow on-screen guidance for your chosen exercise. Fully customizable for your therapy needs.
```

**Game Status**: âœ… Working
- Configuration screen for duration and mode selection
- Supports both camera and handheld modes
- Custom joint tracking selection (elbow/armpit)
- Flexible for various therapeutic exercises
