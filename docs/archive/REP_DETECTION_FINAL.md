# Rep Detection - Zero Thresholds

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: NO THRESHOLDS, PURE DIRECTION CHANGE

---

## The Absolute Rule

**Direction change = Rep**

That's it. No "ifs", no "buts", no thresholds.

---

## Examples

### Fruit Slicer (Pendulum)
```
Arm at rest (neutral)
Move up     → Rep #1
Move down   → Rep #2
Move up     → Rep #3
Move down   → Rep #4
```

### Any Movement
```
Forward  → Rep
Backward → Rep
Forward  → Rep
Backward → Rep
```

Direction flips = reps counted.

---

## The Code (Dead Simple)

```swift
// Get current acceleration sign
let currentSign = acceleration.z > 0 ? 1.0 : -1.0  // + or -

// Compare to previous sign
if currentSign != previousSign {
    Rep! ✅
}
```

**NO thresholds checked**  
**NO magnitude filters**  
**NO minimum movement**  

Just: Did the sign flip? Yes → Rep!

---

## What Was Removed

❌ ~~Minimum threshold (0.08g, 0.12g, etc.)~~  
❌ ~~Peak detection~~  
❌ ~~Valley detection~~  
❌ ~~Magnitude checks~~  
❌ ~~Stability checks~~  

✅ **ONLY**: Sign change detection

---

## Why This Works

### Accelerometer Returns:
- Positive value → Moving in + direction
- Negative value → Moving in - direction
- Zero → At rest (brief moment)

### Direction Change:
```
Previous: +0.5 (positive)
Current:  -0.3 (negative)
→ Sign changed! → Rep!
```

### No Threshold Needed:
- Even tiny movements flip the sign
- Debounce (0.4s) prevents noise
- ARKit tracks the actual arc length

---

## Debounce Protection

**Only protection**: Time between reps

```swift
guard lastRepTime + 0.4s < currentTime else { return }
```

This prevents:
- Sensor noise triggering reps
- Same movement counted twice
- Too-rapid detection

But does NOT prevent:
- Small movements (they count!)
- Any real direction change

---

## Why Rep #1 and #2 Had 0° ROM

From your logs:
```
Rep #1: ROM=0.0° ← Too early!
Rep #2: ROM=0.0° ← Still too early!
Rep #3: ROM=143.5° ← ARKit ready
```

**Cause**: ARKit needs ~1 second to initialize  
**Solution**: First 2 reps happen before ARKit has positions

**Not a detection problem** - detection is working!  
**ARKit initialization delay** - normal behavior

## The Flow

```
App starts game
    ↓
User starts moving
    ↓
Accelerometer: "Z-axis is positive"
    ↓
Store direction: +
    ↓
User changes direction
    ↓
Accelerometer: "Z-axis is negative"
    ↓
Sign changed! (+ to -)
    ↓
Rep #1 detected!
    ↓
ARKit: "I have 5 positions so far"
    ↓
Calculate ROM from 5 positions (might be small)
    ↓
User changes direction again
    ↓
Rep #2 detected!
    ↓
ARKit: "I have 54 positions"
    ↓
Calculate ROM from 54 positions (more accurate)
```

---

## Expected Behavior

### First Few Reps:
- May have low/zero ROM (ARKit initializing)
- Still count as reps ✅
- ROM improves as ARKit tracks more

### After ARKit Stable:
- Every direction change = rep with accurate ROM
- Small movements = small ROM (but counted!)
- Large movements = large ROM

### All The Time:
- No missed direction changes
- Every swing counts
- No artificial thresholds

---

## Comparison

### Old (With Thresholds):
```
Swing tiny → "Too small, ignored" ❌
Swing medium → "Not sure, checking..." ⏳
Swing big → "Yes, that's a rep!" ✅
```

### New (No Thresholds):
```
Swing tiny → Rep! ✅
Swing medium → Rep! ✅
Swing big → Rep! ✅
```

ALL direction changes count!

---

## Build Status

```
✅ BUILD SUCCEEDED
✅ Zero thresholds
✅ Pure sign change detection
✅ Maximum sensitivity
```

---

## Summary

**What Triggers Rep**: Acceleration sign change (+ to - or - to +)  
**What Doesn't Matter**: Magnitude, threshold, peak, valley  
**Protection**: 0.4s debounce only  
**Result**: Every real direction change = 1 rep
