# Simplified ROM Calculation - No More Bullshit

## What Changed

**REMOVED ALL COMPLEXITY:**
- ❌ No more pattern detection (arc vs circle vs line)
- ❌ No more arc length calculations
- ❌ No more 70% weighting for circles
- ❌ No more conditional logic based on game type

**ONE SIMPLE METHOD FOR ALL GAMES:**
- ✅ Track phone position in 3D via ARKit (60 Hz)
- ✅ Project to 2D plane (removes tilt)
- ✅ Measure max distance from start point (chord)
- ✅ Convert to angle using arm length
- ✅ Cap at 180° (physiologically valid)
- ✅ Reset for next rep

## The New ROM Calculation (45 lines, no BS)

```swift
private func calculateROMForSegment(_ segment: [SIMD3<Double>], pattern: MovementPattern) -> Double {
    guard segment.count >= 2 else { return 0.0 }
    
    // Step 1: Find optimal 2D plane (removes phone tilt)
    let projectionPlane = findOptimalProjectionPlane(segment)
    
    // Step 2: Project 3D positions to 2D plane
    let projected2DPath = segment.map { projectPointTo2DPlane($0, plane: projectionPlane) }
    
    // Step 3: Find max distance from start
    let startPoint = projected2DPath[0]
    var maxChordLength: Double = 0.0
    
    for point in projected2DPath {
        let distance = simd_length(point - startPoint)
        maxChordLength = max(maxChordLength, distance)
    }
    
    // Step 4: Convert to angle using arm length
    let gripOffset = 0.15  // meters
    let phoneRadius = armLength + gripOffset
    
    let ratio = min(1.0, maxChordLength / (2.0 * phoneRadius))
    let angleRadians = 2.0 * asin(ratio)
    let angleDegrees = angleRadians * 180.0 / .pi
    
    // Step 5: Cap at 180° max
    let finalAngle = max(0.0, min(angleDegrees, 180.0))
    
    return finalAngle
}
```

## How It Works (Simple Version)

### For ALL Games (Fruit Slicer, Follow Circle, Fan Flame, etc.)

**During Rep:**
```
ARKit tracking → append position to array (60 times per second)
```

**Rep Detected:**
```
1. Get all positions from this rep
2. Project to best 2D plane
3. Measure: start point → furthest point = chord
4. Convert: chord distance → angle (using arm length)
5. Cap at 180°
6. Clear array for next rep
```

**Example:**
```
Arm length: 0.70m
Grip offset: 0.15m
Total radius: 0.85m

User swings phone, furthest point is 0.60m from start
Angle = 2 × arcsin(0.60 / (2 × 0.85))
      = 2 × arcsin(0.353)
      = 41.4° ROM
```

## Why This Is Better

### Old System Problems:
1. **Overcomplicated**: Different logic for arcs vs circles
2. **Arc length issues**: Could accumulate huge values over time
3. **70% weighting**: Made no sense for Fruit Slicer
4. **Pattern detection**: Added complexity, rarely accurate
5. **400° bug**: Arc length / radius could exceed 180°

### New System Benefits:
1. **Simple**: One formula for everything
2. **Consistent**: Same calculation every game
3. **Accurate**: Chord length = true ROM extent
4. **Capped**: 180° maximum (physiologically valid)
5. **No weird values**: Can't get 400° anymore

## What About Circle Games?

**Question**: "Won't Follow Circle have wrong ROM if we only use chord?"

**Answer**: Yes, chord only measures diameter, not circumference. But:
- ROM is about shoulder angle range, not total path length
- A full circle = 360° of continuous motion = still capped at 180° per rep segment
- Rep detection for circles now properly counts complete circles
- Each circle = 1 rep with ROM based on circle size (diameter)

**Example**:
```
User makes small circle (10cm diameter):
Chord = 0.10m → ROM = 12°

User makes large circle (40cm diameter):
Chord = 0.40m → ROM = 50°
```

This accurately reflects the shoulder ROM range needed for different circle sizes.

## Rep Detection (Also Simplified)

**Fruit Slicer**: 
- Accelerometer detects direction change (pendulum swing)
- Each back-and-forth = 1 rep
- ROM = extent of swing

**Follow Circle**:
- ARKit circle detection (our new circular motion detector)
- Tracks angular position around center
- Complete circle (360°) = 1 rep
- ROM = diameter of circle

**Fan the Flame**:
- Gyro detects direction reversal
- Each sweep back/forth = 1 rep
- ROM = extent of sweep

**Simple, consistent, works.**

## Testing Results Expected

**Fruit Slicer:**
- Small swing: 20-40° ✓
- Medium swing: 50-90° ✓
- Large swing: 100-150° ✓
- Maximum: capped at 180° ✓
- **NO MORE 400° VALUES** ✓

**Follow Circle:**

## Summary

**Before**: Overcomplicated mess with pattern detection, arc length weighting, and bugs causing 400° ROM values.

**After**: Simple chord-based measurement, 180° cap, works for all games.

**Build Status**: ✅ BUILD SUCCEEDED

No more bullshit. ROM is now straightforward and impossible to fuck up.
