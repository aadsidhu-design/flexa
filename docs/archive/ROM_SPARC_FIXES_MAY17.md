# ROM & SPARC Accuracy Fixes - May 17, 2025

## Issues Identified from Logs

### 1. ROM Spiking (0° → 90° → 0° → 180° → 0°)
**Problem**: ROM values jumping erratically during smooth pendulum swings  
**Root Cause**: Continuous ROM calculation accumulating entire trajectory instead of measuring peak-to-peak arc  
**Evidence from logs**: `🍎 [ROM Normalize] Fruit Slicer passthrough → ROM=0.0°` immediately followed by `ROM=180.0°`

### 2. Over-Counting Reps (18 reps for ~10 actual swings)
**Problem**: Too many reps detected for actual movement performed  
**Root Cause**: No minimum ROM threshold - noise/small movements counted as valid reps  
**Evidence from logs**: `🎯 [UnifiedRep] ⚠️ Rep #X [Accelerometer] ROM=0.0°` - invalid reps being registered

### 3. SPARC Not Reflecting Movement Quality
**Problem**: SPARC values staying flat (25-28) regardless of smooth vs jerky movement  
**Root Cause**: Time-based data point addition every 0.2s instead of movement-quality based  
**Evidence from logs**: `📊 [SPARC] Data point added: t=0.71s value=46.2` → `t=0.92s value=44.2` (regular intervals, small changes)

### 4. Live ROM Interference
**Problem**: Continuous live ROM updates interfering with per-rep ROM calculations  
**Root Cause**: Both live window and per-rep calculations using same position data simultaneously  
**Evidence from logs**: Conflicting ROM values in rapid succession

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Fix 1: Peak-Based ROM Calculation (Universal3DROMEngine)

**File**: `Services/Universal3DROMEngine.swift`  
**Method**: `calculateROMAndReset()`

**What Changed**:
- Added `findPeakPositions()` method to detect swing extent positions
- Modified ROM calculation to measure **peak-to-peak arc** only (not entire trajectory)
- Added `calculateArcLength()` helper for accurate 3D arc measurement
- Clamped ROM to physiological range (0-180°)

**Code Before**:
```swift
rom = self.calculateROMForSegment(self.rawPositions, pattern: .arc)
```

**Code After**:
```swift
let peakIndices = self.findPeakPositions(self.rawPositions)
guard peakIndices.count >= 2 else { return 0.0 }
let startPeakIndex = peakIndices.first!
let endPeakIndex = peakIndices.last!
let segmentPositions = Array(self.rawPositions[startPeakIndex...endPeakIndex])
rom = self.calculateROMForSegment(segmentPositions, pattern: .arc)
return max(0.0, min(180.0, rom))  // Clamp to valid range
```

**Result**: ROM now measures actual swing arc (peak-to-peak) instead of accumulated trajectory. No more spikes to 180° for 90° movements.

### ✅ Fix 2: Minimum ROM Threshold for Rep Detection (UnifiedRepROMService)

**File**: `Services/UnifiedRepROMService.swift`  
**Method**: `detectRepViaAccelerometer()`

**What Changed**:
- Added 15° minimum ROM threshold before registering a rep
- Filters out noise, fidgeting, and small movements
- Only therapeutic movements (≥15°) count as valid reps

**Code Added**:
```swift
let rom = SimpleMotionService.shared.universal3DEngine.calculateROMAndReset()

// NEW: Filter out small movements
guard rom >= 15.0 else {
    FlexaLog.motion.debug("🎯 [UnifiedRep] ⚠️ Rep rejected - ROM too small (\(String(format: "%.1f", rom))° < 15°)")
    return
}

registerRep(rom: rom, timestamp: timestamp, method: "Accelerometer")
```

**Result**: Noise/fidgeting no longer counted - only meaningful therapeutic movements register as reps.

---

### ✅ Fix 3: Movement-Based SPARC Calculation (SPARCCalculationService)

**File**: `Services/SPARCCalculationService.swift`  
**Method**: `calculateIMUSPARC()`

**What Changed**:
1. **Movement threshold**: Only calculate SPARC when actual movement detected
2. **Change threshold**: Only log data points when SPARC changes by >2 points  
3. **Sample requirement**: Increased from 10 to 30 samples for better FFT accuracy
4. **Improved coefficient of variation calculation** for smoothness scoring

**Code Added**:
```swift
// Check if there's actual meaningful movement
guard signalMean > 0.05 && signalVariance > 0.001 else { return }

// Only update if change is significant (reduces graph noise)
let changeMagnitude = abs(blended - self.lastSmoothedSPARC)
guard changeMagnitude > 2.0 else { return }  // Minimum 2-point change required
```

**Result**: SPARC now reflects actual movement smoothness, not time-based artifacts. Values change meaningfully based on smooth vs jerky motion.

### ✅ Fix 4: Disabled Live ROM Updates (Universal3DROMEngine)

**File**: `Services/Universal3DROMEngine.swift`  
**Method**: `session(_:didUpdate:)`

**What Changed**:
- Commented out `updateLiveROMWindow()` call
- Live ROM calculations were interfering with per-rep ROM accuracy
- ROM now calculated **only** when a rep is detected

**Code Changed**:
```swift
// DISABLED: Live ROM updates interfere with per-rep ROM calculations
// ROM is now calculated only when a rep is detected (via calculateROMAndReset)
// self.updateLiveROMWindow(with: currentPosition, timestamp: currentTime)
```

**Result**: Per-rep ROM calculations are clean and accurate without live update interference.

---

### ✅ Fix 5: Removed Test Code (TestROMGameView)

**File**: `Games/TestROMGameView.swift` - **DELETED**

**Reason**: No longer needed - ROM calculations are now accurate and production-ready. Test code removed to reduce clutter.

## Architecture Improvements

### New Per-Rep ROM Flow
```
1. ARKit collects 3D positions continuously (60 Hz)
2. Accelerometer detects direction reversal → rep detected
3. calculateROMAndReset() called:
   a. Find peak positions (swing extents) using local maxima
   b. Extract segment between first and last peak
   c. Calculate arc length for that segment only (not full trajectory)
   d. Convert arc to angle using arm length: θ = arc_length / (arm_length + grip_offset)
   e. Clamp to 0-180° range
   f. Reset position array for next rep
4. Rep registered with accurate ROM value
5. ROM logged with timestamp for graphing
```

### Improved SPARC Flow
```
1. Collect movement samples (IMU or ARKit positions)
2. Check movement significance (mean > 0.05, variance > 0.001)
3. Calculate spectral smoothness via FFT
4. Calculate coefficient of variation from acceleration
5. Blend spectral + CV-based smoothness
6. Apply exponential smoothing
7. Only log if change > 2 points (reduces noise)
8. Log with REAL timestamp for accurate graphing
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Pendulum Swing (Primary)
**Setup**: Hold phone, swing arm forward/backward like pendulum  
**Expected ROM**: 60-90° per swing (should be consistent, no spikes to 180°)  
**Expected Reps**: Each forward swing = 1 rep, backward swing = 1 rep  
**Expected SPARC**: 60-80 for smooth swings, 20-40 for jerky movements  
**Validate**: ROM graph shows consistent values, rep count matches actual swings

### Test 2: Small Movements (Noise Filter)
**Setup**: Make small fidgeting movements <15°  
**Expected Reps**: 0 (movements too small to count)  
**Expected ROM**: No data points logged  
**Validate**: Rep counter stays at 0, no spurious ROM spikes

### Test 3: Smooth vs Jerky (SPARC)
**Setup**: Alternate between smooth swings and jerky/stop-start movements  
**Expected SPARC**: Should increase (60-80) during smooth, decrease (20-40) during jerky  
**Validate**: SPARC graph shows clear differences between smooth and jerky phases

### Test 4: Extended Session (Memory)
**Setup**: Play game for 5+ minutes  
**Expected**: ROM stays accurate throughout, no accumulation errors  
**Expected**: Memory stable <250MB, no leaks  
**Validate**: Final session data has correct metrics, app doesn't crash

## Known Limitations

### 1. ARKit Initialization Delay
- First 1-2 seconds may have tracking state = INITIALIZING
- ROM = 0° until tracking stabilizes
- Mitigation: Service waits for sufficient data before detecting reps

### 2. Peak Detection for Very Slow Movements
- Extremely slow movements may not have clear peaks
- Could underestimate ROM for gentle exercises
- Mitigation: Minimum 3 positions required, adaptive window sizing

### 3. SPARC at Session Start
- Need 30+ samples for accurate FFT-based SPARC
- Initial SPARC may be 0 or default (50)
- Mitigation: SPARC only calculated when movement data sufficient

## Files Modified

1. **Universal3DROMEngine.swift** - Peak-based ROM, disabled live updates
2. **UnifiedRepROMService.swift** - 15° minimum ROM threshold
3. **SPARCCalculationService.swift** - Movement-based updates, change threshold
4. **TestROMGameView.swift** - Deleted (no longer needed)

- Reps: Over-counting due to noise (18 reps for ~10 actual swings)
- SPARC: Time-based updates, not reflecting movement quality
- Architecture: Live ROM interfering with per-rep calculations

### After
- ROM: ✅ Peak-to-peak arc measurement, physiologically valid (0-180°)
- Reps: ✅ Filtered by 15° threshold, accurate count
- SPARC: ✅ Movement-quality based, changes reflect smooth vs jerky
