# ROM Limits Removed + TestROM Uses Universal3D

## Changes Made

### 1. **All ROM Limits Removed** ✅

#### What was changed:
- Removed all ROM clamping (no more 0-180° artificial limits)
- Removed minimum ROM thresholds (no rep rejection based on ROM)
- Removed maximum ROM limits (accept any measured value)

#### Why:
- Users want to see **actual measured angles** without artificial constraints
- Therapeutic thresholds shouldn't prevent data collection
- Edge cases (hyperextension, large movements) should be captured, not hidden

#### Files Modified:

**Universal3DROMEngine.swift**:
```swift
// Before: return max(0.0, min(180.0, rom))
// After:  return max(0.0, rom)  // Only ensure non-negative

// calculateROMForSegment() - removed physiological clamping
let finalAngle = max(0.0, angleDegrees)  // Was: min(180.0, angleDegrees)
```

**UnifiedRepROMService.swift**:
```swift
// validateROM() - no more clamping
return ValidatedROM(
    value: rom,  // Raw value, no clamping
    isTherapeutic: isTherapeutic,
    wasClamped: false  // Never clamp
)

// registerRep() - removed minimum ROM check
// Before: guard validated.value >= currentProfile.minimumROM
// After:  NO GUARD - accept all ROMs

// All game profiles updated:
minimumROM: 0    // Was: 10-30 depending on game
maximumROM: 999  // Was: 45-180 depending on game
```

### 2. **TestROM Now Uses Universal3D Engine** ✅

#### What it does:
TestROM game/exercise now uses the **exact same ROM calculation** as handheld games (Fruit Slicer, Follow Circle, etc.)

#### Key features:
- ✅ Uses Universal3D engine with ARKit position tracking
- ✅ Same 3D-to-2D projection algorithm (PCA-based)
- ✅ Same pattern detection (line/arc/circle)
- ✅ Same chord/arc length calculations
- ✅ Manual capture: Start ROM → Move → Stop ROM
- ✅ Shows history of captured reps
- ✅ Supports arc and circle modes

#### TestROM Implementation:
```swift
// Uses Universal3D engine directly
motionService.startGameSession(gameType: .testROM)

// Capture flow:
startCapture() → User moves phone → stopCapture()

// ROM calculation (same as games):
let rom = motionService.universal3DEngine.computeROM(
    for: segment, 
    patternOverride: mode.pattern
)
```

### 3. **Pattern Detection Enhanced** ✅

Added `CustomStringConvertible` to `MovementPattern` for better logging:
```swift
enum MovementPattern: CustomStringConvertible {
    case line, arc, circle, unknown
    
    var description: String {
        switch self {
        case .line: return "line"
        case .arc: return "arc"
        case .circle: return "circle"
        case .unknown: return "unknown"
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing TestROM

### Setup:
1. Build to device (ARKit requires physical iPhone)
2. Complete calibration
3. Navigate: Home → Games → Test ROM

### Usage:
1. **Select pattern**: Arc (pendulum) or Circle (stirring)
2. **Press "Start Game"** → Initializes Universal3D engine
3. **Press "Start ROM"** → Begins capturing 3D positions
4. **Move phone** in selected pattern
5. **Press "Stop ROM"** → Calculates ROM from captured path
6. **View result** → Shows measured angle + history

### Expected Behavior:
```
Arc Mode (20-90° typical):
- Small swing: ~20-40°
- Medium swing: 40-70°
- Large swing: 70-120°

Circle Mode (30-150° typical):
- Small circle: ~30-60°
- Medium circle: 60-100°
- Large circle: 100-180°
```

### Verify Same Algorithm:
TestROM and handheld games should produce **identical ROM values** for the same movement because they use the same calculation:
1. ARKit tracks 3D phone position
2. PCA finds optimal 2D plane
3. Projects positions to 2D
4. Calculates chord + arc length
5. Converts to angle using arm length

## Benefits

### No ROM Limits:
- ✅ See actual measured angles (e.g., 192° if measured)
- ✅ Debug calibration issues (high values indicate bad calibration)
- ✅ Capture edge cases (hyperextension, extreme movements)
- ✅ Research applications (study abnormal ROM patterns)

### TestROM with Universal3D:
- ✅ Test the exact algorithm used in games
- ✅ Validate calibration accuracy
- ✅ Compare arc vs. circle ROM calculations
- ✅ Debug ROM calculation issues
- ✅ Training tool for therapists

## Migration Notes

### For Game Developers:
**No changes needed!** Games automatically benefit from:
- Removed ROM limits (all measured values accepted)
- Improved pattern detection
- Better logging

### For TestROM Users:
- Previous TestROMExerciseView still exists (legacy)
- New TestROMGameView uses Universal3D (recommended)
- Both views available for comparison

## Console Logs to Watch

```bash
# Rep detection with pattern
🎯 [Universal3D] Rep ROM: 87.3° (pattern: arc)

# Projection plane selection
📐 [ROM Calc] Plane=XZ Chord=0.523m Arc=0.612m Angle=87.3°

# No minimum ROM rejection
🎯 [UnifiedRep] ✅ Rep #3 [Accelerometer] ROM=12.4°

# Outside normal range (logged but not clamped)
🎯 [UnifiedRep] ROM outside normal range: 205.3° (normal: 0-180°)
```

## Known Implications

### High ROM Values May Indicate:
1. **Bad calibration** → Arm length set too short
2. **Multiple movements** → Rep captured more than one swing
3. **Tracking issue** → ARKit lost tracking, position jumped
4. **Actual hyperextension** → User has exceptional ROM

### Low ROM Values:
- Small movements (5-15°) now counted as valid reps
- Micro-adjustments may be captured
- Games still have movement detection thresholds (0.12g, etc.)

```

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful**
- All compilation errors resolved
- MovementPattern conforms to CustomStringConvertible
- No warnings (except unused variables in other files)

## Next Steps

1. **Test on device**: Deploy to iPhone and test TestROM
2. **Validate ROM values**: Compare TestROM with handheld games
3. **Check extreme cases**: Try very small/large movements
4. **Monitor logs**: Watch for "outside normal range" warnings
5. **Verify calibration**: If ROM seems consistently high/low, recalibrate

---

**Key Takeaway**: ROM measurement is now **pure data collection** without artificial limits. The system reports what it measures, and users/therapists interpret therapeutic significance.
