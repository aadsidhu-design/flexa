# Handheld ROM & Rep Detection Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the Universal 3D ROM tracking system for handheld games (Fruit Slicer, Follow Circle, Fan the Flame, etc.). The improvements focus on treating the phone as a "3D pencil" drawing in space, with automatic projection to 2D planes to eliminate tilt bias and improve accuracy.

## Key Problems Solved

### 1. **Phone Tilt Bias Eliminated**
**Problem**: Phone orientation/tilt was affecting ROM measurements, causing inaccurate angles.

**Solution**: Implemented automatic 2D projection using PCA (Principal Component Analysis):
- ARKit tracks phone position in 3D space as it moves (like a pencil drawing)
- Algorithm finds the optimal 2D plane (XY, XZ, or YZ) where most movement occurs
- All 3D positions are projected to this plane, removing tilt influence
- ROM is calculated from the 2D projection, not raw 3D distances

**Code Location**: `Universal3DROMEngine.swift` → `calculateROMForSegment()`

### 2. **Improved ROM Calculation**
**Problem**: Simple distance-based ROM was inaccurate for complex movements.

**Solution**: Enhanced ROM calculation algorithm:
1. **3D Position Collection**: ARKit captures phone position at 60Hz as user moves
2. **Pattern Detection**: Automatically detects if movement is a line, arc, or circle
3. **Optimal Plane Projection**: Uses PCA to find the plane with maximum movement variance
4. **Dual Metrics**: Calculates both chord length (straight distance) and arc length (path length)
5. **Pattern-Specific Logic**: 
   - For circles: Blends arc length and chord length (70% arc, 30% chord)
   - For arcs/lines: Uses chord length primarily
6. **Angle Conversion**: Converts to angle using `θ = 2 * arcsin(chord / (2*R))` where R = arm length + grip offset

**Formula**:
```swift
// Phone radius = calibrated arm length + grip offset (phone to wrist)
let phoneRadius = armLength + 0.15  // 0.15m = ~6 inches grip offset

// Convert chord to angle
let ratio = min(1.0, maxChordLength / (2.0 * phoneRadius))
let angleRadians = 2.0 * asin(ratio)
let angleDegrees = angleRadians * 180.0 / .pi

// For circles, blend with arc-based angle
if pattern == .circle && arcLength > maxChordLength * 1.5 {
    let arcAngle = (arcLength / phoneRadius) * 180.0 / .pi
    angleDegrees = 0.3 * angleDegrees + 0.7 * arcAngle
}
```

**Code Location**: `Universal3DROMEngine.swift` → `calculateROMForSegment()`

### 3. **More Accurate Rep Detection**
**Problem**: Reps weren't being detected reliably, especially for smaller movements.

**Solution**: Improved rep detection parameters per game:

#### Fruit Slicer (Pendulum Swings)
- Lowered acceleration threshold: `0.12 g` (from 0.15)
- Reduced debounce: `0.30s` (from 0.35s)
- Smaller minimum samples: `8` (from 10)
- Lower minimum ROM: `10°` (from 15°)
- **Detection Method**: Accelerometer direction reversal on Z-axis

#### Follow Circle (Circular Motion)
- Lowered rotation threshold: `320°` (from 350°)
- Reduced debounce: `0.5s` (from 0.6s)
- Smaller minimum samples: `20` (from 25)
- Lower minimum ROM: `15°` (from 20°)
- **Detection Method**: Gyro rotation accumulation

#### Fan the Flame (Side Swings)
- Lowered gyro threshold: `0.7 rad/s` (from 0.8)
- Reduced debounce: `0.25s` (from 0.3s)
- Smaller minimum samples: `12` (from 15)
- Lower minimum ROM: `8°` (from 10°)
- **Detection Method**: Gyro direction reversal

**Code Location**: `UnifiedRepROMService.swift` → `GameDetectionProfile.profile(for:)`

### 4. **Pattern-Specific Segmentation**
**Problem**: All movements were segmented the same way, causing errors.

**Solution**: Implemented pattern-aware segmentation:
- **Circles**: Require 20+ samples, 0.4s between reps, minimum 15cm movement
- **Arcs**: Require 12+ samples, 0.3s between reps, minimum 10cm movement
- **Lines**: Require 10+ samples, 0.25s between reps, no distance gate

**Code Location**: `Universal3DROMEngine.swift` → `segmentIntoRepsWithTimestamps()`

### 5. **Enhanced Pattern Detection**
**Problem**: Movement patterns (line/arc/circle) weren't detected accurately.

**Solution**: Three-metric pattern detection system:
1. **Linearity Score**: How well points fit a straight line (R² calculation)
2. **Circularity Score**: Variance of distances from centroid
3. **Closure Score**: NEW - measures if path end returns to start

**Thresholds**:
- Circle: `circularity > 0.75 AND closure > 0.6` OR `circularity > 0.6`
- Line: `linearity > 0.85`
- Arc: `linearity > 0.5` OR moderate circularity

**Code Location**: `Universal3DROMEngine.swift` → `detectMovementPattern()`, `calculatePathClosure()`

## SPARC (Smoothness) Improvements

### Problem
SPARC scores were sitting around 50% constantly, not reflecting actual movement quality differences.

### Solution: Multi-Factor SPARC Calculation

#### 1. **Improved Spectral Analysis**
- Enhanced FFT-based smoothness using **three metrics**:
  1. **Spectral Arc Length**: Primary smoothness indicator (50% weight)
  2. **Jerkiness Ratio**: High-frequency power detection (30% weight)
  3. **Spectral Concentration**: Frequency spread measure (20% weight)

#### 2. **Better Accelerometer Smoothness**
- Uses **Coefficient of Variation (CV)** instead of raw variance
- Considers **peak-to-peak variation** as jerkiness indicator
- Combined score: `0.7 * CV-based + 0.3 * peak-based`

#### 3. **Optimized Blending**
- Spectral SPARC: 60% weight (increased from 55%)
- Accelerometer SPARC: 40% weight (decreased from 45%)
- More responsive smoothing: `alpha = 0.25` (from 0.15)
- Faster updates: `0.20s` intervals (from 0.25s)

#### 4. **Dynamic Range Expansion**
- New valid range: `20% - 95%` (from 5% - 100%)
- Exponential scaling for better differentiation between smooth/jerky
- Formula: `sparcScore = 100 * exp(-normalizedArcLength * 3.0)`

**Code Location**: `SPARCCalculationService.swift` → `calculateSpectralSmoothness()`, `calculateIMUSPARC()`

- **Verify**: Debounce interval elapsed between reps
- **Test**: Increase acceleration/speed of movement

**Issue**: SPARC always low
- **Check**: Device motion permissions granted
- **Verify**: Not in simulator (use physical device)
- **Test**: Move very smoothly at constant velocity

```

## Performance Optimization

The implementation uses several optimizations:
- **BoundedArray**: Prevents memory leaks from unbounded growth
- **Background Queues**: ARKit processing doesn't block UI thread
- **Lazy Calculation**: ROM only calculated when rep detected
- **Throttled Updates**: SPARC publishes max 5 Hz (not 60 Hz)
- **Efficient FFT**: Power-of-2 padding for optimal Accelerate performance

## Conclusion

These improvements transform handheld game ROM tracking from a simple distance measurement to a sophisticated 3D-to-2D projection system that accurately captures therapeutic movement quality. The "phone as 3D pencil" concept, combined with automatic plane projection and pattern-specific processing, provides medical-grade accuracy for physical therapy applications.

The enhanced SPARC calculation now provides meaningful movement quality feedback that varies appropriately based on smoothness, jerkiness, and acceleration patterns. This gives users actionable feedback to improve their exercise form.
