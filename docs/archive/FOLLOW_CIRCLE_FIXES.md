# Follow the Circle Game - Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cursor Circle Not Moving
**Problem**: The cursor was using Vision-based wrist tracking (`motionService.poseKeypoints`) instead of ARKit device motion tracking. Follow the Circle is a **handheld game**, not a camera-based game, so the cursor should track the device's physical position in 3D space.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `updateUserCirclePosition()` to use `motionService.universal3DEngine.currentTransform` instead of Vision pose keypoints
- The cursor now tracks actual device movement using ARKit transforms
- Maps 3D device position (X/Z axes) to 2D screen coordinates
- Uses baseline calibration captured at game start for relative positioning
- Applied smoothing factor of 0.35 for fluid movement while maintaining responsiveness

**Key Changes**:
- Lines 404-478: Complete rewrite of cursor positioning logic
- Uses ARKit transforms: X-axis → horizontal screen movement, Z-axis → vertical screen movement  
- Screen scale of 180.0 for appropriate sensitivity
- Renamed `handTrackingUnavailable()` to `arkitTrackingUnavailable()` for accuracy

### 2. ROM/Reps Tracking Before Game Starts
**Problem**: ROM and reps were being tracked and displayed immediately when the motion service started, even during the 5-second "Get Ready!" countdown. This could confuse users and provide inaccurate data.

**Solution**: Added `gracePeriodEnded` checks throughout the code to prevent ROM/reps updates until after the 5-second countdown completes:

1. **Initial Reset** (lines 274-276):
   - Reset score, reps, and ROM to 0 when game starts
   
2. **onReceive Callbacks** (lines 194-209):
   - Added `&& gracePeriodEnded` condition to all three `onReceive` callbacks
   - `currentReps`, `currentROM`, and `maxROM` only update UI after grace period
   
3. **updateGame()** (lines 403-406):
   - ROM binding only updated if `gracePeriodEnded` is true
   
4. **updateUserCirclePosition()** (lines 468-472):
   - Reps/ROM only read from motion service after grace period ends
   
5. **arkitTrackingUnavailable()** (lines 481-485):
   - Same grace period check when ARKit tracking is unavailable

6. **Logging** (line 302):
   - Added informative log message indicating tracking activates after grace period

## Technical Details

### ARKit Coordinate Mapping
```swift
// Device movement → Screen coordinates
X-axis (device left/right) → Horizontal screen position
Z-axis (device forward/back) → Vertical screen position (inverted)
Y-axis (device up/down) → Not used for cursor

// Screen scale calibration
let screenScale: CGFloat = 180.0  // Sensitivity multiplier
let deltaX = CGFloat(delta.x) * screenScale
let deltaZ = CGFloat(-delta.z) * screenScale  // Negative: forward = cursor up
```

### Grace Period State Management
```swift
// Grace period: 5 seconds
private let gracePeriodDuration: TimeInterval = 5.0

// Checked in updateGame() at line 329-333
if !gracePeriodEnded && Date().timeIntervalSince(gameStartTime) >= gracePeriodDuration {
    gracePeriodEnded = true
    // ... activate tracking
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Cursor Movement**: 
   - Hold device and move in circular patterns
   - Cursor should follow device position smoothly
   - Test horizontal (left/right) and vertical (forward/back) movements
   
2. **Grace Period**:
   - Launch game and observe countdown (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
   - Verify reps/ROM stay at 0 during countdown
   - Confirm tracking begins only after "Get Ready!" disappears
   - Move device during countdown and verify no reps are counted

3. **ARKit Tracking**:
   - Test in well-lit environment for best ARKit performance
   - Verify cursor recenters if tracking is lost
   - Double-tap screen to manually recalibrate center position

## Build Status
✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED** - Verified compilation on iOS Simulator

## Files Modified
- `FlexaSwiftUI/Games/FollowCircleGameView.swift` (lines 194-485)

## Related Architecture
According to project documentation:
- Follow the Circle is classified as a **handheld game** (uses IMU/ARKit)
- Camera games (Balloon Pop, Wall Climbers, Constellation) use Vision pose detection
- Handheld games (Fruit Slicer, Fan the Flame, Witch Brew, Follow Circle) use device motion
