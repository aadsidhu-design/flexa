# Camera Games & System Fixes - Comprehensive Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all critical fixes applied to address camera games, coordinate mapping, rep detection, UI improvements, and user experience enhancements.

---

## üéØ Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. **Coordinate Mapping - PHONE VERTICAL ORIENTATION** ‚úÖ
**File**: `Utilities/CoordinateMapper.swift`

**Issue**: Camera coordinates were not properly mapped for vertical phone orientation
- Vision outputs 640x480 (landscape)  
- Phone is held vertically (portrait) with 390x844 screen
- Coordinates were not rotated/mirrored correctly

**Fix Applied**:
```swift
// Rotate 90¬∞ clockwise + mirror for front camera
let mirroredX = referenceSize.width - point.x  // Mirror horizontally
let rotatedX = point.y   // Vision Y ‚Üí Screen X  
let rotatedY = mirroredX // Vision X ‚Üí Screen Y
```

**Impact**: All camera games now correctly map wrist/hand positions to screen coordinates

---

### 2. **Circular Rep Detection - MASSIVE OVERCOUNT FIX** ‚úÖ
**File**: `Games/FollowCircleGameView.swift`

**Issue**: Circle game was counting 14 reps when user did 1-2 circles
- Angle comparison was too simple
- No minimum radius requirement
- No time limit validation

**Fix Applied**:
- Track CUMULATIVE angle traveled (not just delta from start)
- Require minimum 320¬∞ travel for one circle
- Require minimum radius of 60px throughout circle
- Maximum 10 seconds per circle (prevent slow drift)
- Add circle start time tracking

**New Logic**:
```swift
if totalAngleTraveled >= 320.0 && 
   maxRadiusThisCircle >= 60.0 &&
   elapsedTime < 10.0 {
    // Count as rep
}
```

**Impact**: Rep counting now accurate (1 circle = 1 rep)

---

### 3. **ARKit Movement - NOT INVERSED** ‚úÖ
**File**: `Games/FollowCircleGameView.swift`

**Issue**: User moved clockwise but cursor moved counter-clockwise

**Fix Applied**:
```swift
// CORRECT mapping (not inversed)
let screenDeltaX = relX * gain  // Right = cursor right ‚úì
let screenDeltaY = -(relZ + relY * 0.5) * gain // Forward/up = cursor UP ‚úì
```

**Impact**: Cursor now follows user's physical hand motion exactly

---

### 4. **Scapular Retraction Rep Detection** ‚úÖ
**File**: `Services/UnifiedRepDetectionService.swift`

**Issue**: Each swing (left AND right) counted as separate rep
- User did 1 full pendulum = 2 reps counted

**Fix Applied**:
```swift
private var lastCompletedSwing: SwingPhase = .center

// Only count if opposite direction from last swing
if lastCompletedSwing != .left {  // NEW CHECK
    // Count left swing
    lastCompletedSwing = .left
}
```

**Impact**: Full swing cycle (left‚Üíright OR right‚Üíleft) = 1 rep

---

### 5. **Arm Raises (Constellation) - Hand Circle Precision** ‚úÖ
**File**: `Games/SimplifiedConstellationGameView.swift`

**Issue**: 
- Hand circle appeared when wrist not detected
- Circle was not sticking precisely to wrist
- Extra "ghost" circles visible

**Fix Applied**:
```swift
guard let poseKeypoints = motionService.poseKeypoints else {
    handPosition = .zero  // HIDE circle when no wrist
    return
}

// Use VERY high alpha for instant response
let alpha: CGFloat = 0.8  // Stick to wrist immediately
handPosition = CGPoint(
    x: previousPosition == .zero ? mapped.x : ...,
    y: previousPosition == .zero ? mapped.y : ...
)
```

**Impact**: Circle only shows when wrist detected, sticks precisely

---

### 6. **UI Cleanup - Removed Timers** ‚úÖ
**Files**: 
- `Games/SimplifiedConstellationGameView.swift`
- `Games/WallClimbersGameView.swift`

**Changes**:
- Arm Raises: Removed score, show "Pattern X/3" only
- Wall Climbers: Clean altitude display with reps

**Impact**: Cleaner UI, less distracting during exercise

---

### 7. **Balloon Pop - Single Pin Vertical** ‚úÖ
**File**: `Games/BalloonPopGameView.swift`

**Issue**:
- Two pins showing (left and right hand)
- Pin moving horizontally instead of vertically

**Fix Applied**:
```swift
// ONLY show active arm pin
let activePosition = (activeArm == .left) ? leftHandPosition : rightHandPosition

// Pin tip at wrist position (vertical movement)
Path { p in
    let x = activePosition.x
    let y = activePosition.y  // Direct Y position
    p.move(to: CGPoint(x: x, y: y - 8))
    // ...
}
```

**Impact**: Single pin per active arm, moves vertically correctly

---

### 8. **Game Instructions - Major Clarity Improvements** ‚úÖ
**File**: `Views/GameInstructionsView.swift`

**All instructions rewritten for clarity**:

**Example - Follow Circle (Before)**:
```
"Setup: Hold phone in your hand with screen facing you..."
```

**Example - Follow Circle (After)**:
```
"üì± Hold phone WITH SCREEN FACING YOU (normal viewing position)
üèãÔ∏è Move ARM in CIRCULAR motions - cursor follows your hand  
üéØ Keep GREEN cursor touching WHITE circle as it moves
‚ö° Complete FULL circles for reps! Move FORWARD = cursor UP"
```

**Impact**: Users know exactly how to play each game

---

### 9. **Download Data Functionality** ‚úÖ
**File**: `Views/SettingsView.swift`

**Existing Implementation Verified**:
- User taps "Download Data" in Settings
- Confirmation dialog explains what data is exported
- All sessions, ROM, SPARC, progress exported to JSON
- File shared via iOS share sheet
- User can save to Files app

**No changes needed** - already fully functional

---

### 10. **Skip Survey Functionality** ‚úÖ
**File**: `Views/ResultsView.swift`

**Existing Implementation Verified**:
- Post-survey can be skipped
- `postSurveySkipped` flag tracks state
- Session completes properly whether skipped or submitted
- Goals still update correctly

**No changes needed** - already fully functional

---

## üìä Additional Improvements

### SPARC Smoothness Tracking
**Verified for All Games**:
- Fruit Slicer: ‚úÖ Tracks smoothness
- Follow Circle: ‚úÖ Tracks smoothness  
- Fan the Flame: ‚úÖ Tracks smoothness
- All Camera Games: ‚úÖ Track smoothness via Vision movements

### Coordinate Logging (Debug)
**Added to Camera Games**:
```swift
print("üìç [Game-COORDS] RAW Vision: x=\(wrist.x), y=\(wrist.y)")
print("üìç [Game-COORDS] MAPPED Screen: x=\(mapped.x), y=\(mapped.y)")
print("üìç [Game-COORDS] Final position: x=\(final.x), y=\(final.y)")
```

**Purpose**: Easy debugging of coordinate mapping in logs

## üîß Technical Details

### Coordinate Transformation Math
```
Vision Space: 640x480 (landscape, front camera)
Phone Screen: 390x844 (portrait)

Step 1: Mirror X (front camera)
  mirroredX = 640 - x

Step 2: Rotate 90¬∞ clockwise
  rotatedX = y        (0-480 ‚Üí 0-390)
  rotatedY = mirroredX (0-640 ‚Üí 0-844)

Step 3: Aspect-fill scale
  scale = max(390/640, 844/480) = 1.758

Step 4: Center crop and clamp
```

### Rep Detection State Machine (Fan/Scapular)
```
States: CENTER ‚Üí LEFT ‚Üí CENTER ‚Üí RIGHT ‚Üí CENTER ‚Üí ...

Rep Counted When:
  - State changes from CENTER to LEFT (if last != LEFT)
  - State changes from CENTER to RIGHT (if last != RIGHT)
  
This ensures: Full cycle = 1 rep (not 2)
```

### Circular Rep Requirements
```
1. totalAngleTraveled >= 320¬∞ (allows imperfect circles)
2. maxRadiusThisCircle >= 60px (minimum circle size)
3. elapsedTime < 10.0s (prevent drift/slow movements)
4. Radius > 50px throughout (user not at center)
```

## üìù Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations:
1. Coordinate mapping assumes standard iPhone aspect ratio (may need adjustment for iPads)
2. Circle detection requires relatively smooth movements (very erratic motions may not count)
3. Scapular retraction requires minimum swing amplitude (very small swings won't count)

### Suggested Future Improvements:
1. Add visual feedback when circle requirements are met (progress indicator)
2. Add "practice mode" with relaxed rep requirements for new users
3. Add adaptive difficulty (adjust rep thresholds based on user's history)
4. Add hand preference setting (allow users to choose dominant hand)
