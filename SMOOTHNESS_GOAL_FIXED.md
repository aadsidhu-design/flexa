# Smoothness Goal Circle - FIXED âœ…

## Problem
The smoothness goal circle on the home screen was not updating after completing handheld games (Fruit Slicer, Fan Out Flame, Follow Circle).

## Root Cause
In `SimpleMotionService.createSessionDataSnapshot()`, handheld games were setting `sparcScore` to **0** with the intention of calculating it later on the analyzing screen:

```swift
} else {
    // Handheld games: Set SPARC to 0 - will be calculated on analyzing screen
    finalSPARC = 0.0
}
```

However, this meant:
1. Session data was saved with `sparcScore = 0`
2. Uploaded to Firebase with `sparcScore = 0`
3. Goal calculation read `sparcScore = 0` from cached sessions
4. Smoothness goal circle showed 0/target

## The Fix
Changed handheld games to use the average SPARC from the session's SPARC history:

```swift
} else {
    // Handheld games: Use average from SPARC history if available
    let sparcValues = sparcHistory.allElements.filter { $0.isFinite && $0 > 0 }
    if !sparcValues.isEmpty {
        finalSPARC = sparcValues.reduce(0, +) / Double(sparcValues.count)
        FlexaLog.motion.info(
            "ðŸ“Š [Handheld] Using average SPARC: \(String(format: "%.1f", finalSPARC)) from \(sparcValues.count) samples"
        )
    } else {
        finalSPARC = 0.0
        FlexaLog.motion.info(
            "ðŸ“Š [Handheld] SPARC deferred to analyzing screen..."
        )
    }
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Handheld Games (Fruit Slicer, Fan Out Flame, Follow Circle)
1. **During gameplay**: SPARC is calculated continuously from ARKit position data
2. **SPARC values stored** in `sparcHistory` array
3. **Session ends**: Average SPARC calculated from history
4. **Session data saved** with real `sparcScore` value (not 0)
5. **Uploaded to Firebase** with real SPARC score
6. **Goal calculation** reads real SPARC from cached sessions
7. **Smoothness goal circle updates** with actual progress

### Camera Games (Balloon Pop, Wall Climbers, Constellation)
1. **During gameplay**: SPARC calculated from wrist position trajectory
2. **Session ends**: SPARC calculated from wrist trajectory
3. **Session data saved** with real `sparcScore`
4. **Works as before** (was already working)

## Data Flow

```
Handheld Game Session
â†“
ARKit Position Updates â†’ SPARC Service
â†“
SPARC values stored in sparcHistory
â†“
Session Ends â†’ Calculate average SPARC
â†“
sparcScore = average(sparcHistory)
â†“
Save to ExerciseSessionData
â†“
Upload to Firebase
â†“
Cache in LocalDataManager
â†“
GoalsAndStreaksService.calculateProgress()
â†“
todayProgress.bestSmoothness = session.sparcScore
â†“
ActivityRingsView displays progress
```

## Expected Behavior

After this fix:
- âœ… Handheld games will show real SPARC scores (typically 40-90)
- âœ… Smoothness goal circle will update after each session
- âœ… Progress will be visible immediately on home screen
- âœ… Firebase will receive real SPARC data (not 0)

## Testing

1. **Play a handheld game** (Fruit Slicer recommended)
2. **Complete 5-10 reps** with smooth movements
3. **Check session results** - should show SPARC score > 0
4. **Return to home screen** - smoothness goal should update
5. **Check logs** for: `"ðŸ“Š [Handheld] Using average SPARC: XX.X from N samples"`

## Verification

Check the logs after a handheld game session:
```
ðŸ“Š [Handheld] Using average SPARC: 67.3 from 8 samples
ðŸ“Š [SessionData] Final metrics â€” reps=8 maxROM=145.2Â° avgROM=132.4Â° SPARC=67.3 source=deferred-to-analyzing
```

If you see `SPARC=0.0`, the fix didn't work. If you see a real value (40-90), it's working!

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Smoothness goal circle will now update correctly for handheld games.
