# IMU Rep Detector Fix - Complete Overhaul ‚úÖ

## Problem
Rep detection was completely broken with **0 reps detected** and no IMU logs appearing.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Wrong IMU Detector**: System was using old `IMURepDetector` (velocity-based) instead of new `IMUDirectionRepDetector` (acceleration-based with gravity calibration)
2. **Missing Logging**: No debug logs to trace the detection pipeline
3. **No ROM Reset**: ROM wasn't being reset between reps, causing accumulation

## ‚úÖ BUILD SUCCEEDED

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Replaced Old IMU Detector
- **DELETED**: `FlexaSwiftUI/Services/Handheld/IMUrepdetector.swift` (old velocity-based detector)
- **USING**: `FlexaSwiftUI/Services/IMUDirectionRepDetector.swift` (new acceleration-based with gravity calibration)

### 2. Added Comprehensive Debug Logging

#### Startup Logs
```
üöÄ [SETUP] Starting IMU rep detector for Pendulum Swing
‚ö°Ô∏è [IMURep] Started session on Y axis with adaptive filtering
‚ö°Ô∏è [IMURep] IMU rep detection active: true for Pendulum Swing
```

#### Data Flow Logs
```
üì± [IMU-DATA] Feeding motion to IMU rep detector
```

#### Calibration Logs
```
‚ö°Ô∏è [IMURep] Calibration sample 1/30: (0.123, -0.987, 0.045)
‚ö°Ô∏è [IMURep] Calibration sample 2/30: (0.134, -0.976, 0.056)
...
‚ö°Ô∏è [IMURep] Calibrated - gravity: (0.012, -0.981, 0.045)
```

#### Movement Detection Logs
```
‚ö°Ô∏è [IMURep] Axis Y value: 0.234, magnitude: 0.234, threshold: 0.150
‚ö°Ô∏è [IMURep] Direction: 1, Last: 0, Confidence: 0.50
‚ö°Ô∏è [IMURep] First direction detected: 1
```

#### Rep Detection Logs
```
üîÑ [IMURep] Direction reversal detected: 1 ‚Üí -1, confidence: 0.25
‚úÖ [REP DETECTED] Rep #1 | Direction: 1 ‚Üí -1 | Accel: 0.234 m/s¬≤
üéØ [IMU-CALLBACK] Rep detected callback triggered - reps: 1
üîÅ [Motion] Handheld rep completed - ROM: 45.3¬∞, Total reps: 1
üîÑ [Motion] ROM reset for next rep
```

### 3. Added ROM Reset Between Reps
```swift
func completeHandheldRep() {
    let timestamp = Date().timeIntervalSince1970
    handheldROMCalculator.completeRep(timestamp: timestamp)
    
    // Update last rep ROM for display
    lastRepROM = handheldROMCalculator.getLastRepROM()
    
    FlexaLog.motion.info("üîÅ [Motion] Handheld rep completed - ROM: \(String(format: "%.1f", lastRepROM))¬∞, Total reps: \(currentReps)")
    
    // Reset ROM for next rep
    handheldROMCalculator.resetLiveROM()
    FlexaLog.motion.info("üîÑ [Motion] ROM reset for next rep")
}
```

## Key Changes

### SimpleMotionService.swift
1. Changed detector type: `IMURepDetector` ‚Üí `IMUDirectionRepDetector`
2. Added startup logging
3. Added callback logging
4. Added data flow logging
5. Enhanced `completeHandheldRep()` with ROM reset and logging

### IMUDirectionRepDetector.swift
1. Added `processDeviceMotion()` method to accept CMDeviceMotion
2. Added calibration sample logging
3. Added movement detection logging
4. Added direction tracking logging
5. Added rep detection logging

## How to Debug

Run the game and check logs in this order:

1. **Startup**: Look for `üöÄ [SETUP]` and `‚ö°Ô∏è [IMURep] Started session`
2. **Data Flow**: Look for `üì± [IMU-DATA] Feeding motion`
3. **Calibration**: Look for 30 calibration samples, then `Calibrated - gravity`
4. **Movement**: Look for `‚ö°Ô∏è [IMURep] Axis Y value` logs
5. **Direction**: Look for `Direction: X, Last: Y, Confidence: Z`
6. **Reps**: Look for `üîÑ Direction reversal` and `‚úÖ [REP DETECTED]`

## Expected Behavior

- **Calibration**: 30 samples (~0.5 seconds) to determine gravity
- **Movement Detection**: Logs every frame showing axis value and magnitude
- **Direction Changes**: Logs when direction reverses with confidence
- **Rep Detection**: Logs when rep is confirmed with ROM value
- **ROM Reset**: Logs when ROM is reset for next rep
