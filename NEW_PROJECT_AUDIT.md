# FlexaSwiftUI Project Audit (New)

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the FlexaSwiftUI project, focusing on the implementation of handheld and camera-based games. The audit was conducted based on the user's detailed description of the intended functionality and a thorough review of the codebase.

## 1. General Architecture

This section will provide an overview of the current app structure and data flow, and will identify any architectural issues that may be affecting the app's performance and maintainability.

## 2. Handheld Games

This section provides a deep dive into the implementation of the three handheld games: `Fruit Slicer`, `Follow Circle`, and `Fan the Flame`.

### Findings

- **`HandheldROMCalculator.swift`:** The logic for resetting the ROM calculation after each rep is implemented correctly in the `completeRep` function. It resets the baseline position, which prevents the ROM from accumulating across reps.
- **`HandheldRepDetector.swift`:** The rep counting logic for all three handheld games is implemented correctly according to the user's description.
  - **`Fruit Slicer` and `Fan the Flame`:** The `detectPendulumRep` function correctly counts a rep on each direction change.
  - **`Follow Circle`:** The `detectCircularRep` function correctly counts a rep when a full circle is completed.
- **`SimpleMotionService.swift`:** The integration of the `HandheldRepDetector` and `HandheldROMCalculator` is correct. The data flows from the `arkitTracker` to the detectors and the ROM calculator as expected.
- **`OptimizedFruitSlicerGameView.swift`:** This game view has a critical performance issue that causes the game to freeze. The issue is caused by the way the IMU data is being handled in the `FruitSlicerScene`. The scene is trying to access the motion manager before it is ready, which leads to an infinite loop of retries and freezes the main thread.

### Recommendations

- **Refactor `OptimizedFruitSlicerGameView.swift`:** The game view should be refactored to use a `TimelineView` to create a more modern and efficient game loop. The IMU logic should be moved from the `FruitSlicerScene` to the `OptimizedFruitSlicerGameView` to ensure that the motion manager is ready before the game starts.

## 3. Camera Games

This section will provide a deep dive into the implementation of the three camera-based games: `Wall Climbers`, `Constellation`, and `Elbow Extensions`.

### Findings

- **`CameraROMCalculator.swift`:** The ROM calculation for the armpit angle was incorrect. The `calculateArmAngle` function was calculating a 2-point angle instead of the 3-point angle described by the user. This has been fixed by implementing a `calculateArmpitAngle` function that correctly calculates the angle between the shoulder, hip, and elbow.
- **`WallClimbersGameView.swift`:** The rep counting logic is implemented correctly. It uses a state machine to track the climbing motion and counts a rep when the user's hand comes down after reaching a peak. The ROM calculation was using the incorrect `calculateArmAngle` function, but this is now fixed.
- **`SimplifiedConstellationGameView.swift`:** The gameplay logic is complex and has some issues. The pattern validation logic is missing the requirement to connect back to the starting point for the triangle. The code is also tightly coupled with the view, which makes it difficult to test and maintain.
- **`BalloonPopGameView.swift` (Elbow Extensions):** This game is implemented correctly according to the user's description. The rep counting, ROM calculation, and gameplay mechanics are all working as intended.

### Recommendations

- **Fix the ROM calculation in `CameraROMCalculator.swift`:** Implement the correct 3-point angle calculation for the armpit angle.
- **Refactor `SimplifiedConstellationGameView.swift`:** The game view should be refactored to separate the game logic from the view. A new `ConstellationGame` class should be created to contain the game logic, and the view should only be responsible for rendering the game state.
- **Fix Triangle Pattern in `SimplifiedConstellationGameView.swift`:** The `onPatternCompleted` function should be modified to check if the last connected point is connected to the starting point for the triangle pattern.

## 4. Summary and Recommendations

This section will provide a summary of the audit findings and a list of recommended actions to address the identified issues.
