## Progressive Difficulty System (Future Implementation)

### Infinite Gameplay Loops
- **Fruit Slicer**: Fruits spawn less frequently over time, requiring better timing and bigger swings for movement detection
- **Witch Brew**: Cauldron bar decreases faster over time, requiring more consistent movements to maintain progress
- **Hammer Time**: Nails become smaller/harder to hit, requiring more precise movements
- **Wall Climbers**: Holds become smaller and require more accurate positioning
- **Balloon Pop**: Balloons move faster and in more complex patterns
- **Potion Mixer**: Mixing requirements become more precise with tighter tolerance windows

### Failure States & Difficulty Scaling
- Games progressively increase difficulty until user reaches natural failure point
- No manual difficulty selection - adaptive scaling based on performance
- Failure triggers game end with performance summary and encouragement to try again
- Difficulty resets on new session but remembers user's best performance levels

### Bomb System for Fruit Slicer
- Bombs randomly spawn among fruits (10-15% spawn rate)
- 3-strike system: hitting bombs shows red X in top-left counter
- 3 strikes = game over with explosion animation
- Adds risk/reward element to encourage careful movement

### Game Mechanics Refinements
#### Witch Brew Improvements
- Remove timer-based mechanics
- Cauldron bar decreases over time automatically
- User movements increment the bar to fight the decrement
- Goal: fill bar completely to summon scary witch and complete level
- Visual: Bubbling cauldron with rising/falling liquid level

#### Painting Game Updates
- Remove time constraints
- Focus on movement accuracy and smoothness
- Completion based on coverage percentage, not time
- Allow unlimited time for therapeutic benefit
