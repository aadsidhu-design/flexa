# Code Audit Report

## Issues Found

### 1. Navigation
- NavigationCoordinator is overly complex with NavigationPath enum
- Multiple navigation patterns (notifications, coordinators, direct presentation)
- Inconsistent navigation between games

### 2. Duplicate Services
- romEngine created in individual games (FruitSlicer, WitchBrew) when SimpleMotionService already has Universal3DEngine
- Multiple motion tracking approaches

### 3. Unused Code
- Deprecated folder is empty but exists
- NavigationCoordinator can be replaced with simpler NavigationManager
- Duplicate results/survey views

### 4. Service Issues
- Games initialize their own romEngine instead of using shared SimpleMotionService
- Motion services not properly cleaned up

## Fixes Applied
1. Created NavigationManager - simpler navigation
2. Will remove duplicate romEngine from games
3. Will consolidate motion tracking through SimpleMotionService
4. Will remove unused files and organize structure
