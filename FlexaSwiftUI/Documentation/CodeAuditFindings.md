# FlexaSwiftUI Code Audit Findings
*Date: September 8, 2024*

## Critical Issues

### 1. Memory Management
- **Universal3DROMEngine**: Potential memory leak with ARSession and AVCaptureSession not being properly cleaned up in all paths
- **FruitSlicerScene**: Timer references not invalidated in all cleanup paths, could cause retain cycles
- **Motion services**: Multiple motion managers and tracking services running simultaneously without proper lifecycle management

### 2. Thread Safety
- **SimpleMotionService**: Accessing UI properties from background queues without proper synchronization
- **Universal3DROMEngine**: Publishing properties modified from multiple threads (ARSession delegate, AVCapture delegate)
- **Rep detection services**: Shared state being modified from different queues

### 3. Performance Issues
- **FruitSlicerScene**: Array operations in hot path (updateSlicerFromMotion called 45 times/second)
- **Multiple camera sessions**: Both ARKit and AVCapture running simultaneously for same purpose - oh no. 
- **Excessive timer usage**: Multiple high-frequency timers (1/45s) running concurrently across games

## Architecture Problems

### 1. Service Duplication
- **ROM Tracking**: Multiple overlapping systems (ARKitROMTracker, SimpleARKitROMTracker, IMU3DROMTracker, Universal3DROMEngine)
- **Motion Services**: SimpleMotionService doing too much - should be split into smaller focused services
- **Pose Providers**: Multiple pose provider implementations with unclear separation of concerns

### 2. State Management
- **Global singletons**: Over-reliance on shared instances makes testing difficult
- **Inconsistent state updates**: Some using @Published, others using notifications, some using callbacks
- **Missing state validation**: No checks for invalid state transitions in games

### 3. Navigation Flow
- **Circular dependencies**: Games depending on motion service which depends on games
- **Inconsistent navigation**: Mix of NavigationView, fullScreenCover, and programmatic navigation
- **Missing back navigation**: Some views don't properly handle navigation state

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. Error Handling
- **Silent failures**: Many try-catch blocks with empty catch or just print statements
- **Missing nil checks**: Force unwrapping optionals in several places
- **No recovery strategies**: Errors just stop execution without fallback

### 2. Magic Numbers
- **Hardcoded thresholds**: ROM thresholds, timing values, positions scattered throughout code
- **Screen dimensions**: Using UIScreen.main.bounds directly instead of GeometryReader
- **Animation durations**: Hardcoded timing values without constants

### 3. Code Duplication
- **Rep detection logic**: Similar patterns repeated across different game files
- **Session data creation**: Duplicated in every game view
- **Camera obstruction handling**: Similar code in multiple places

## Missing Features





### 3. Documentation
- **Missing API documentation**: Most public methods lack documentation
- **No architecture documentation**: System design not documented
- **Outdated comments**: Many TODO/FIXME comments that seem outdated

## Security Concerns

### 1. Data Privacy
- **Camera permissions**: Not checking permissions before accessing camera
- **Motion data**: No user consent for motion tracking
- **Appwrite data**: Uploading user data without clear consent flow

### 2. API Keys
- **Hardcoded configurations**: Some API configurations in code
- **Missing encryption**: Sensitive data stored in UserDefaults without encryption

## Platform Issues

### 1. iOS Version Support
- **Deprecated APIs**: Using deprecated AVCaptureVideoOrientation
- **Missing availability checks**: Not checking for feature availability on older iOS versions
- **SwiftUI compatibility**: Using iOS 16+ features without fallbacks

### 2. Device Support
- **iPad layout**: Not optimized for iPad screens - dont care
- **Landscape orientation**: Games don't handle landscape properly - only portrait mode our app is in so dont care
- **Small screen devices**: UI elements overlap on smaller screens.

## Specific File Issues

### SimpleMotionService.swift
- Line 986-987: stopCaptureSession() and appleVisionService commented out but marked as TODO
- Line 1009-1010: Duplicate universal3DEngine.reset() calls
- Mixed responsibilities: Camera, motion, pose detection all in one service

### Universal3DROMEngine.swift
- Line 100: Back camera hardcoded, should be configurable
- Line 432: Magic number for low light threshold (100 lux)
- Line 515-522: Brightness thresholds hardcoded without configuration

### Games (All)
- Inconsistent game end handling
- Missing pause menu functionality
- No settings/difficulty adjustment
- Timer cleanup issues in multiple games

### TestROMExerciseView.swift
- Missing error handling for ARKit initialization
- No feedback when ARKit is unavailable
- Missing calibration flow

### CameraObstructionOverlay.swift
- Animation could cause performance issues
- Missing haptic feedback for state changes

## Database/Storage Issues

### 1. Local Storage
- **UserDefaults abuse**: Storing complex objects in UserDefaults
- **No data migration**: No versioning for stored data structures
- **Missing cleanup**: Old session data never cleaned up

### 2. Firebase
- **No offline support**: App doesn't handle offline scenarios
- **Missing retry logic**: Failed uploads are lost
- **No batch operations**: Uploading data one at a time

## UI/UX Issues

### 1. Feedback
- **Missing loading states**: No feedback during long operations
- **Inconsistent error messages**: Different styles across app
- **No success feedback**: Actions complete without confirmation

### 2. Animations
- **Janky transitions**: Some animations not smooth
- **Missing animations**: State changes happen instantly
- **Excessive animations**: Some views have too many concurrent animations

## Build Configuration Issues

### 1. Dependencies
- **Outdated pods**: Some CocoaPods dependencies are outdated
- **Version conflicts**: Potential conflicts between Firebase versions
- **Missing version pinning**: Some dependencies not version-locked

### 2. Build Settings
- **No code signing configuration**: Missing proper provisioning setup
- **Debug code in release**: NSLog and print statements in production code
- **Missing optimization flags**: Build settings not optimized for performance

## Recommendations Priority

### High Priority (Fix immediately)
1. Thread safety issues in motion services
2. Memory leaks in ARKit/camera sessions
3. Missing camera permission checks
4. Force unwrapping causing crashes

### Medium Priority (Fix soon)
1. Service architecture refactoring
2. Error handling improvements
3. Performance optimizations
4. Navigation flow fixes

### Low Priority (Future improvements)

3. Test coverage
4. Documentation updates

## Technical Debt Summary
- **Estimated effort**: 200+ hours to address all issues
- **Risk level**: High - current code has stability issues
- **Recommendation**: Prioritize critical fixes before adding new features
