# Final Fixes Complete ✅

## 🎯 Critical Fix: BlazePose Edge Filter

### The Problem
BlazePose was being filtered out constantly with these warnings:
```
🚫 [ZERO-FILTER] Edge position detected: (0.793633, 0.918284)
🚫 [ZERO-FILTER] Filtered invalid camera pose - likely initialization artifact
```

### Root Cause
The edge filter was checking if landmarks were within pixel coordinates (10-470, 10-630), but **BlazePose returns NORMALIZED coordinates (0-1)**!

So a landmark at `x=0.79` (79% across the screen) was being compared to `x > 470` and failing the check.

### The Fix
Changed edge detection from pixel coordinates to normalized coordinates:

**BEFORE** (wrong):
```swift
if landmark.x < 10 || landmark.x > 470 || landmark.y < 10 || landmark.y > 630 {
    // Filter out
}
```

**AFTER** (correct):
```swift
if landmark.x < 0.02 || landmark.x > 0.98 || landmark.y < 0.02 || landmark.y > 0.98 {
    // Filter out only if truly at edges (2% margin)
}
```

### Result
✅ BlazePose now detects landmarks correctly!
✅ Camera games work properly!
✅ Circle follows wrist in Constellation!
✅ No more constant filtering!

## 📥 Download Data Functionality - IMPLEMENTED

### New Service: DataExportService
**File**: `FlexaSwiftUI/Services/DataExportService.swift`

### What It Exports
- ✅ All exercise sessions (comprehensive data)
- ✅ ROM measurements per rep
- ✅ SPARC scores and history
- ✅ User goals and progress
- ✅ Streak data
- ✅ Custom exercises created by user
- ✅ Session number (preserved)
- ✅ User ID (preserved)
- ✅ Timestamps and metadata

### Export Format
**JSON file** with structure:
```json
{
  "exportDate": "2025-01-13T10:30:00Z",
  "appVersion": "1.0.0",
  "userId": "anonymous_user_id",
  "sessionNumber": 42,
  "totalSessions": 25,
  "goals": { ... },
  "streak": { ... },
  "customExercises": [ ... ],
  "sessions": [ ... ]
}
```

### File Location
`Documents/Flexa/Flexa_Export_2025-01-13_103000.json`

### User Flow
1. Tap "Download Data" in Settings
2. Confirm download
3. App exports all data to JSON
4. Share sheet opens automatically
5. User can:
   - Save to Files app
   - Share via AirDrop
   - Email to themselves
   - Upload to cloud storage

### Features
- ✅ Background processing (no UI lag)
- ✅ Haptic feedback
- ✅ File size and session count displayed
- ✅ Automatic share sheet
- ✅ Pretty-printed JSON (human-readable)
- ✅ Timestamped filenames

## 🗑️ Delete Data - Already Working

### What Gets Deleted
- ✅ All exercise sessions
- ✅ Goals and progress
- ✅ Streak data
- ✅ Custom exercises (via LocalDataManager.clearLocalData())

### What Gets Preserved
- ✅ Session number (via BackendService.refreshSessionSequenceBaseFromCloud())
- ✅ User ID (stored in UserDefaults, not cleared)

### Implementation
Already implemented in `SettingsView.clearAllData()`:
```swift
try await backendService.clearAllUserData()
// Calls LocalDataManager.clearLocalData()
// Preserves session number via refreshSessionSequenceBaseFromCloud()
```
