# ARKit Initialization Delay for Handheld Games

## What Was Added

Added a 1-second initialization delay to ensure ARKit is fully stabilized before ROM and rep counting begins for handheld games.

## Why This Matters

**Problem:** Previously, position data was sent to rep and ROM detectors immediately when ARKit frames arrived. This caused:
- ❌ False reps detected during startup instability
- ❌ Incorrect baseline positions captured
- ❌ Poor ROM measurements from unstable tracking
- ❌ User confusion when reps count before they're ready

**Solution:** Now ROM and reps only start counting after:
1. ARKit tracking state becomes `.normal` (stable)
2. 1 second has passed since tracking became stable

## Implementation Details

### New Properties in `InstantARKitTracker`

```swift
/// Is ARKit fully initialized and stable?
@Published private(set) var isFullyInitialized = false

/// ARKit initialization delay - wait for stable tracking
private let arkitInitializationDelay: TimeInterval = 1.0
private var arkitInitializedTime: TimeInterval?
```

### Tracking States

1. **Starting:** User opens handheld game
   - `isTracking = false`
   - `isFullyInitialized = false`
   - No position callbacks fired

2. **Tracking Normal:** ARKit achieves stable tracking
   - `isTracking = true`
   - `isFullyInitialized = false`
   - Timer starts: `arkitInitializedTime` captured
   - Still no position callbacks (initialization period)

3. **Fully Initialized:** 1 second after stable tracking
   - `isTracking = true`
   - `isFullyInitialized = true` ✅
   - Position callbacks fire → ROM and reps start counting

### Code Flow

```swift
func session(_ session: ARSession, didUpdate frame: ARFrame) {
    // Check if tracking is stable
    let isTrackingNormal = camera.trackingState == .normal
    
    // Start timer when tracking becomes stable
    if isTrackingNormal && self.arkitInitializedTime == nil {
        self.arkitInitializedTime = timestamp
        // Log: "Tracking became normal - starting 1.0s initialization period"
    }
    
    // Check if initialization period has passed
    let isInitialized: Bool
    if let initTime = self.arkitInitializedTime {
        isInitialized = (timestamp - initTime) >= self.arkitInitializationDelay
        if isInitialized && !self.isFullyInitialized {
            // Log: "✅ Fully initialized - ROM and reps will now be tracked"
        }
    }
    
    // Only fire position callback if fully initialized
    if isInitialized && isTrackingNormal {
        self.onPositionUpdate?(position, timestamp) // → HandheldRepDetector & HandheldROMCalculator
    }
}
```

## UI Integration (Optional Enhancement)

Games can observe `isFullyInitialized` to show initialization status:

```swift
@StateObject private var motionService = SimpleMotionService.shared

var body: some View {
    ZStack {
        // Game content
        
        // Optional initialization overlay
        if !motionService.arkitTracker.isFullyInitialized {
            VStack {
                ProgressView()
                Text("Initializing tracking...")
                    .foregroundColor(.white)
            }
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
            .background(Color.black.opacity(0.6))
        }
    }
}
```

## When Initialization Resets

Initialization restarts (requires new 1-second period) when:

1. **Game starts:** `SimpleMotionService.startGameSession()`
2. **Tracking reset:** `arkitTracker.resetTracking()`
3. **Session stopped:** `arkitTracker.stop()`
4. **ARKit interruption ends:** Session recovery

## Testing

### Expected Log Sequence (Successful Initialization)

```
📍 [InstantARKit] Tracker initialized
📍 [InstantARKit] Tracking started
📍 [InstantARKit] Tracking became normal - starting 1.0s initialization period
📍 [InstantARKit] ✅ Fully initialized - ROM and reps will now be tracked
🔁 [HandheldRep] Rep #1 completed
📐 [HandheldROM] ROM updated: 45.2°
```

### What Changed for Each Game

**Fruit Slicer, Fan Out Flame, Follow Circle, Make Your Own:**
- ✅ 1-second grace period before counting starts
- ✅ No more false reps during startup
- ✅ Accurate baseline positions
- ✅ Stable ROM measurements

**Camera Games (Balloon Pop, Wall Climbers, etc.):**
- ✅ No changes - they use MediaPipe, not ARKit

## Performance Impact

- **Delay:** 1 second after ARKit tracking becomes stable
- **User Experience:** Slightly delayed start, but much more accurate
- **Battery:** No impact (same ARKit usage)
- **Frame Rate:** No impact (still 60fps ARKit)

## Configuration

To adjust the delay duration, modify:

```swift
private let arkitInitializationDelay: TimeInterval = 1.0 // Change to 0.5, 1.5, etc.
```

**Recommended:** Keep at 1.0 seconds for optimal stability vs responsiveness balance.

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- All existing games work unchanged
- No API changes to SimpleMotionService
- Internal optimization only

## Summary

✅ ROM and reps only count after ARKit is fully initialized  
✅ 1-second stability period after tracking becomes normal  
✅ Prevents false reps and bad baselines  
✅ Observable `isFullyInitialized` property for UI  
✅ Resets properly on game start, tracking reset, and interruptions  
✅ Build successful with all changes  

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅
