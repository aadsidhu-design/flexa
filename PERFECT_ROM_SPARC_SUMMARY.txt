Users can now prompt Gemini with ANY exercise description:

Example 1: "Pendulum swings with my phone"
  → System: Detects pendulum movement
  → Tracks: Z-axis motion
  → Result: Perfect ROM per rep

Example 2: "Make circles in the air with my phone"
  → System: Detects circular movement
  → Tracks: Angle accumulation + radius
  → Result: Perfect circular ROM

Example 3: "Raise my arm to the side"
  → System: Uses camera tracking
  → Tracks: Armpit angle
  → Result: Perfect camera-based ROM

Example 4: "Elbow curls"
  → System: Uses camera tracking
  → Tracks: Elbow flexion angle
  → Result: Perfect elbow ROM per rep

IT JUST WORKS FOR EVERYTHING! 🤯✨
